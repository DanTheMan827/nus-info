	"description": "10/3 Pokédex 3D update details: Updating your Pokédex 3D application is easy. Just launch the application and select the Settings option (the gear icon in the top-right corner). Scroll to the bottom and tap the Update button. You’ll need an Internet connection to get the update. Download the FREE Pokédex™ 3D application available exclusively through Nintendo eShop on the Nintendo 3DS system, and start collecting data on over 150 Pokémon™ from Pokémon Black and Pokémon White Version games! This exciting new application lets you see each Pokémon in 3D with animated motion and sound, and you can rotate the Pokémon image 360 degrees to zoom in and view it from any angle. The detailed Pokédex also allows you to search, sort, and filter all of the data you receive in a variety of ways, making it the essential guide for Pokémon fans! Complete your Pokédex by receiving Pokémon data from friends, using the SpotPass™ feature (wireless broadband Internet access required), or by scanning special Augmented Reality (AR) Markers. Once you have collected data for a Pokémon, the AR Viewer allows you to view that Pokémon image in a real-world setting in real time, and create photos to share with friends!
