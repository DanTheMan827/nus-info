	"description": "Originally released in 1991, this popular action game allowed two characters to be used alternately. Now making its debut on the Nintendo eShop, Fortified Zone brings 4 multi-room levels of heavy-fire and explosions, as well as the mode \"Sound Boy\" where you can listen to the music tracks outside of the action! Enemy forces have created a gigantic fortress in a critical zone, and reports have been coming in that they are developing a powerful secret weapon! Secret agents Masato Kanzaki and Mizuki Makimura have been dispatched to infiltrate the fortress, and venture to the heart of the complex to destroy it. Masato and Mizuki each have their own abilities, so they will need to tag-team their way to breach the enemies' defenses. Join these two in their mission through the Fortified Zone, and destroy the threat!",
