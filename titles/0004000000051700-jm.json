	"description": "Swapnote lets you create handwritten notes and then share those notes with other Swapnote users on your friend list via the StreetPass™ feature. As your note collection grows and you spend Play Coins, you’ll unlock new features and be able to personalize messages even further by changing stationery patterns, attaching photos and sound recordings, writing and drawing in 3D, and more. You’ll even be able to surprise your friends with secret notes that they can only open on a certain date! An update for the Swapnote™ application is available. After you perform the update you can: Attach a photo and/or audio recording when you reply to a note Undo or redo your last pen stroke Use a different pen color on each page of a note Filter your notes to only see those created by a specific user or those marked as favorites Delete multiple notes at once Take photos and record audio from within the application Enjoy faster load times Please note: This update won’t affect your saved data. If you downloaded Swapnote on April 11, 2013 or later, you don’t need to download this update. Check out the theme inspired by this game in the Theme Shop. Just tap the icon in the upper left corner of your Nintendo 3DS HOME Menu to get started.",
