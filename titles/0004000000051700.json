		"description": "Pasacartas te permite crear cartas escritas a mano y compartirlas a través de StreetPass™ con otros usuarios de Pasacartas en tu lista de amigos. A medida que aumente tu colección y al usar monedas de juego podrás desbloquear nuevas opciones y personalizar aún más tus cartas al cambiar el tipo de papel, adjuntar fotos y grabaciones, y escribir y dibujar en relieve. Además puedes sorprender a tus amigos con cartas secretas ¡que solamente se pueden abrir a partir de una fecha concreta! Hay una actualización disponible para la aplicación Pasacartas. Cuando realices la actualización podrás: adjuntar una foto o una grabación a las respuestas; deshacer o rehacer el último trazo; usar una tinta de un color diferente para cada página de tus cartas; filtrar las cartas para que solo se muestren las cartas creadas por el usuario seleccionado o las marcadas como favoritas; borrar varias cartas a la vez; tomar fotos y grabar sonidos sin salir de la aplicación; disfrutar de una mejoría en el tiempo de carga y descarga; Nota: esta actualización no afectará tus datos de guardado. Los usuarios que hayan descargado la aplicación el día 11 de abril de 2013 o más recientemente no necesitan esta actualización. Mira el tema inspirado en este juego en la tienda de temas. Simplemente toca el icono en la esquina superior izquierda del menú HOME de tu consola Nintendo 3DS para comenzar.",
