	"description": "From the critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, a new 3D experience re-imagined from one of the most popular Metal Gear Solid titles from the past, comes Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater. Experience an all-new re-interpretation of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, in 3D for the first time ever. \"Photo Camo\" system utilising the built-in camera technology of the hardware bringing customised stealth and camouflage options to the player. By snapping a photo in the real world, players will be able to use the same image as a camouflage pattern applied to Snake's uniform within the game. Utilising the Gyro Sensor, players will become one with Snake through specialised tilt mechanics throughout the game design. As Snake climbs trees, or traverses bridges and other environmental obstacles, players will be in danger of falling based on the balancing of the system. An intuitive menu utilises the touch screen for quick and easy equipping of items and weapons.",
