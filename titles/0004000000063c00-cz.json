	"description": "Adding a new unique horror setting to the series, Resident Evil: Revelations gives players the chance to venture underwater as they try to escape the terrifying creatures that are roaming a supposedly abandoned cruise ship on the Mediterranean. New storyline featuring series favourites Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield and introducing BSAA member Parker Luciani. Explore the dark, sinister areas of the cruise ship; there's nowhere to run and hide with evil creeping out of the shadows. Touch Screen control scheme adds depth to puzzle solving and provides easy access to switching weapons on the fly. Use the Genesis scanning equipment to analyse enemy weaknesses and hidden items that will prove crucial for the playerâ€™s survival. Players can choose the shooting style that suits them with the ability to alternate between first and third person views to best pinpoint enemies.",
