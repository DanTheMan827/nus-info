	"description": "Original Release Date: August 1990 As young boxer Little Mac, players have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to battle the big guys of the World Video Boxing Association circuit. Take them on one by one, starting with skinny Glass Joe. Battle up through King Hippo and all the way to the WVBA Champion himself. Players use their best jabs, hooks, and power uppercuts to knock out opponents but must also dodge jaw-breaking blows by paying attention to subtle changes in their foe's body position. With great graphics, addictive action, and a touch of humor, this game will keep players entertained for hours!",
