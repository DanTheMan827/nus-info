	"description": "Original Release Date: September 1991 We all knew that Mario™ was a hero, but did you know that he could also be a world-class golfer? You can challenge another player in Stroke, Match and Tournament modes. Play on three fantasy courses in the USA, the UK, and Japan, and try to win a million dollars. Make sure you keep an eye on the wind and distance to the hole before selecting your club, or else you'll be racking up some high scores—which is exactly what you don't want to do in this game. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced golfer, NES Open Tournament Golf is perfect for those days when you just can't get to the local golf course.",
