Você pode desafiar outros jogadores no modo Stroke, Match e Tournament. Jogue em três campos de golfe fictícios nos EUA, Reino Unido, e Japão, e tente ganhar um milhão de dólares. Fique de olho no vento e na distância do buraco antes de selecionar o seu taco, senão você terá uma pontuação muito alta -- o que é justamente o que você não quer neste jogo.

Toma en cuenta el viento y la distancia entre la pelota y el agujero antes de seleccionar tu palo, o acabarás con una puntuación muy alta, justo lo opuesto a lo que quieres hacer en este juego.

Puedes retar a otro jugador en las modalidades Stroke y Match o jugar un torneo contra la consola en el modo Tournament. Juega en tres campos diferentes en Estados Unidos, Reino Unido o Japón e intenta ganar un millón de dólares. Toma en cuenta el viento y la distancia entre la pelota y el agujero antes de seleccionar tu palo, o acabarás con una puntuación muy alta, justo lo opuesto a lo que quieres hacer en este juego. Ya seas novato o experto en golf, NES Open Tournament Golf es el juego ideal para esos días cuando te resulta imposible llegar a tu campo de golf favorito.",

Puedes retar a otro jugador en las modalidades Stroke y Match o jugar un torneo contra la consola en el modo Tournament. Juega en tres campos diferentes en Estados Unidos, Reino Unido o Japón e intenta ganar un millón de dólares. Toma en cuenta el viento y la distancia entre la pelota y el agujero antes de seleccionar tu palo, o acabarás con una puntuación muy alta, justo lo opuesto a lo que quieres hacer en este juego.
