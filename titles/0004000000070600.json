		"description": "Data do lançamento original: outubro 1985 Como Popo, jogadores usam uma marreta confiável para tentar chegar ao topo da montanha. Eles vão tirando lascas dos blocos acima, e depois saltam pelos buracos cavados para chegarem ao próximo nível da montanha. Uma vez que Popo chega ao nível mais alto, ele entra em uma rápida fase de bônus, na qual pode pegar legumes e, quem sabe, alcançar o topo para uma recompensa. Claro, nem todo mundo apoia o passatempo do Popo. Toppies preenchem os buracos que o Popo cavou, então os jogadores devem saltar pelos buracos rapidamente. É muito fácil escorregar nos níveis mais gelados, onde ursos polares, Toppies e outros integrantes de uma fauna feroz não querem deixar que os jogadores tenham sucesso. São 32 picos desafiadores para serem escalados. Você vai encarar?",

		"description": "Fecha de lanzamiento original: octubre 1985 Como Popo, el jugador utilizará un confiable mazo para abrirse camino a través de la montaña. Perfora los bloques que están por encima de tu cabeza hasta hacer un hueco y salta por él para pasar al siguiente nivel de la montaña. Una vez que Popo llegue al nivel superior, entrará a una fase de bonificación, donde tendrá que moverse rápido para recoger tantos vegetables como pueda y con suerte llegar a la cima donde podrá ganarse una gran bonificación de puntos. Por supuesto que no todos están de acuerdo con el pasatiempo de Popo, los Toppies rellenan los huecos de Popo, así que el jugador deberá saltar a través de los huecos rápidamente. Es fácil caerse y deslizarse hacia el nivel anterior en algunos niveles de hielo, ya que los osos polares, al igual que los Toppies y otros animales feroces no quieren a los jugadores allí arriba. Hay 32 cumbres que escalar, ¿podrás con el reto?",
