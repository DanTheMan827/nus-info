Eu acabei de ler sobre essa legendária pirâmide de ouro, e você vai me ajudar a explorá-la. Dentro dela tem muitos tesouros e eu quero pegá-los para mim. Tenho certeza que veremos todos os tipos de inimigos estranhos e chefões grandes e malvados por lá. Então, se você acha que não vai conseguir, largue o jogo agora. Não quero saber de perdedores me fazendo pular em buracos sem fundo, ouviu bem? Veja o ganancioso Wario, enquanto ele explora mundos cheios de vida! Prepare-se! Wario não é mais imortal, então você terá muito trabalho para rolar e pular em caminhos com desafios mais e mais difíceis. Wario será mordido por morcegos, vai virar zumbi, pegar fogo e muito mais – que maneira de ganhar a vida! Mais de vinte fases estão a sua espera! Encontre CDs para ouvir músicas ou colecione tesouros para comprar itens que você pode usar contra os chefões mais bizarros do mundo!",

		"description": "Fecha de lanzamiento original: noviembre de 2001 ¡Oye, tú! ¡Sí, tú! ¡Escucha cuando Wario te habla! Acabo de leer algo sobre una legendaria pirámide de oro, y tú me vas a ayudar a explorarla. Hay un montón de tesoros allí adentro, ¡y lo quiero todo para mí! Seguro que habrá todo tipo de enemigos extraños y duros jefes, así que si no crees que puedas con ellos, más te vale dejar el juego ahora mismo. No quiero que ningún inútil haga que me caiga en un foso, ¿entendido? ¡Únete a Wario en toda su avariciosa gloria y explora mundos vibrantes! ¡Demuestra tu fuerza! Wario ya no es inmortal, así que no será nada fácil rodar, saltar y golpear a través de retos cada vez más difíciles. Las abejas lo picarán, los murciélagos lo morderán, se le prenderá fuego e incluso será convertido en zombi. ¡Vaya manera de ganarse la vida! Te esperan más de veinte etapas en las que puedes buscar discos para escuchar o coleccionar tesoros para comprar objetos que puedes usar contra los jefes más extraños.",
