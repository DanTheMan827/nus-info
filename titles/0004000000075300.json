Enormous worlds and giant bosses that dwarf Yoshi and his young charge await in this rerelease from the Super NES™ classic! Watch that baby! Enemies are everywhere, and you'll have to become more than just a masterful egg-thrower to keep Baby Mario out of their clutches. Ground-Pound, Flutter-Jump, and morph your way to victory!",
