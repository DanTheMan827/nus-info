		"description": "Data do lançamento original: novembro de 2002 Enquanto ajudava em uma missão no planeta SR388, a caçadora de recompensas interestelar, Samus Aran, é atacada, por um parasita X, um organismo com a capacidade de copiar as habilidades de qualquer criatura que infectar. À beira da morte, Samus ™ é salva por uma vacina criada a partir do DNA do último Metroid — o único predator natural do parasita X. Quando o X se espalha pela estação de pesquisa em órbita ao redor do SR388, a enfraquecida Samus é forçada a exterminá-los...ou morrer tentando. Procure pelo X! Jogue o clássico Metroid enquanto a Samus explora as passagens secretas da estação de pesquisa. Viva e aprenda! A Samus precisa dominar novos golpes: agarrando-se em rochas, saltando por escadas altas e usando armas novas como os Diffusion Missiles. Durante o trajeto, junte itens de poderes clássicos. Não tem onde se esconder! O SA-X, o incontrolável X que copiou as habilidades da Samus, está solto, e pode estar em qualquer lugar...",

		"description": "Fecha de lanzamiento original: noviembre de 2002 Mientras se encontraba en una misión en el planeta SR388, la cazarrecompensas Samus Aran es atacada por el parásito X, un organismo que imita las habilidades de las criaturas que infecta. En su lecho de muerte, Samus™ es salvada por una vacuna hecha con el ADN del último metroide, el predador natural de este organismo. Cuando X se disemina en una estación de investigación que está cerca de SR388, la debilitada Samus es obligada a exterminarlos o a morir en el intento. Experimenta el clásico modo de juego de Metroid, mientras juegas y exploras los pasajes secretos de esta masiva estación plagada de formas de vida hostiles. Samus deberá dominar nuevos movimientos como el treparse por las salientes y saltar escaleras, además de disparar armas como misiles de difusión y encontrar las clásicas mejoras. ¡No hay donde esconderse! El SA-X, un imparable X que está imitando a Samus, anda suelto y podría estar en cualquier lugar.",

		"description": "Original Release Date: November 2002 While lending mission support on planet SR388, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite, an organism with the ability to mimic the abilities of any creature it infects. Near death, Samus™ is saved by a vaccine made from the DNA of the last Metroid--the X parasite's only natural predator. When the X spread to a research station in orbit around SR388, a weakened Samus is forced to exterminate them all...or die trying. Search out the X! Experience classic Metroid game play as Samus explores the secret passages of a massive research station teeming with hostile life forms. Live and learn! Samus must master new moves: clinging to ledges, leaping to high ladders, and firing new weapons like Diffusion Missiles. Along the way, collect classic power-ups like the Morph Ball, Screw Attack, and Wave Beam. There's nowhere to hide! The SA-X, an unstoppable X mimicking Samus, is on the loose, and it could be just around the corner...",
