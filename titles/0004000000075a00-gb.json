	"description": "Before he branched out his business to Wii and Nintendo DS, Wario first set up shop on Game Boy Advance in the original WarioWare, Inc.: Minigame Mania! WarioWare is packed with more than 200 wacky microgames, each very simple but played at lightning-fast speed; from hitting a baseball to picking a disembodied nose. Complete multiple microgames in succession, and beat the boss, to clear each stage. There are even bonus games which can be played by two people sharing one Nintendo 3DS system!",
