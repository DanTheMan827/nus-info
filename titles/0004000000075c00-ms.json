	"description": "Original Release Date: July 2004 The Mirror World has been invaded by an evil shadow, and Kirby's got to save the day! Fortunately, he won't have to go it alone! He's been split into four Kirbys of different colors, and with his trusty cell phone he can call up his colorful clones to lend a hand. Call in Red, Yellow, and Green Kirby to help you solve puzzles, fight enemies, or take out the big baddies! Try out Copy Abilities--from the arrow-shooting Cupid Kirby to the melee master, Smash Kirby--as well as all your old favorites. Minigames from the original release on the Game Boy Advance™, such as Crackity Hack and Kirby's Wave Ride, are available to play.",
