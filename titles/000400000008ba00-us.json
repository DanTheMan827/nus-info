	"description": "While the evil genius Dr. Robotnik is testing the ultimate destructive weapon, one of his assistants makes a mistake causing his lab to explode and scatter five Chaos Emeralds across the planet Mobius. Sonic and Tails spin-dash to rescue them. Tricky Knuckles streaks right behind, with sticky-fingered Nack the Weasel joining the hunt. Its a triple-threat race to see who will get the Emeralds first! Three times the action and Triple the Trouble! Loop, blast and super spin-dash through six zones, five bonus rounds and a wild 3-D stage. Check out Sonic's moves as he jams with his awesome Strike Dash, Jet-Boards on snow and ice, rolls in his Spin-Coaster and swims deep under water with Propeller Shoes. Help Tails as he submarines through water with his Sea Fox and Heli-Tails to explore parts of the zone beyond Sonic's reach.",
