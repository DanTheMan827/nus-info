	"description": "Donkey Kong not only launched the career of Mario, when he was known simply as Jumpman, but also of the eponymous ape who went on to become a hero himself. It also laid the foundation for the ‘platform’ genre – still going strong to this day. This NES™ version of the arcade classic was a launch title for the console and is one of the most faithful adaptations of the original. Rescue the kidnapped Pauline from DK’s clutches, negotiating increasingly tricky obstacles and knock that pesky primate off his perch!",
