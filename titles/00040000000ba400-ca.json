	"description": "Several years ago, a strange man made his way to the ruins of an abandoned castle on the outskirts of a small town called Verulia. Since then, the townspeople's fear of the castle has grown, and none would dare venture near it. Recently, a merchant traveled to Verulia and discovered the entire town was deserted. Her story was embellished, as disturbing rumors of a vampire inhabiting the castle spread like wildfire through the land. As Latis has become older and learned more about herself from Cereza, she feels she is destined by her heritage to bring an end to any threat that vampires pose to humanity. Itâ€™s agreed that she must go with Cereza and travel to Verulia. Features: Four magic elements, able to increase three levels. Transform between a daring bat and an invincible wolf. Fight enemies to earn gold and buy rare items. Encounter event battles and confront evil beasts.",
