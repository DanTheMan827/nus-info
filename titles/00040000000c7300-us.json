	"description": "The Save Data Transfer Tool allows Nintendo 3DS users to transfer save data from the packaged version of a game to the downloadable version. Players that originally purchased a physical version of a game will be able to pick up right where they left off with their save data if they decide to download the digital version of the same game. Save data that is transferred to a digital game cannot be moved back to the physical version.",
