	"description": "When you insert a Pokémon Black Version, Pokémon White Version, Pokémon Black Version 2, and Pokémon White Version 2 Game Card into your Nintendo 3DS family system, you'll be able to use Poké Transporter to transfer Pokémon from these games into their own online Boxes. Then, you can easily transfer those Pokémon into compatible Pokémon titles using Pokémon Bank! Note that Poké Transporter cannot return Pokémon to Pokémon Black Version, Pokémon White Version, Pokémon Black Version 2, or Pokémon White Version 2 after they have been stored in an online Box. Note: You may find yourself unable to use Pokémon Bank or Poké Transporter to deposit any Pokémon created illegally by software unauthorised by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo into your online Boxes, or to move these Pokémon between online Boxes.",
