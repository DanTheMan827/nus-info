	"description": "After months of bitter conflict with its neighbor, country A is preparing to unleash its latest machine of war, code-named Kokuga. With access to 9 destructive weapons and an array of power-ups, the compact mobile tank is an elite military machine. Highly-reputed boutique game studio G.rev is pleased to offer this old-school strategic shooter for the Nintendo 3DS. Players are tasked with piloting Kokuga, and must destroy tanks, drones, gun towers and other mecha in 12 different training missions. Each stage culminates with a boss fight, pitting the player against massive heavily-armed bosses. Upon receiving orders for active duty, the player is thrust into action against enemy forces. Structured so gamers have maximum freedom in their game experience, Kokuga is great for both casual game sessions or long challenges. Local and Download Play is supported, so assemble your squad of up to four players! Develop new strategies and help out your teammates by coordinating card use.",
