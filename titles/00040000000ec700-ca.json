	"description": "Etria is a land that has long welcomed explorers…yet even they will discover stories untold. Uncover the truth behind the labyrinth that swallows all. By choosing first to immerse yourself in Story mode, you will encounter the maiden who has lived a thousand years and the growing mystery that surrounds her past—a past that may affect the present and future of Etria.

Scour through the dungeon’s many layers and fend off the unknown to discover the truth behind the Yggdrasil Tree. Choosing either mode will unravel the engrossing tale that signaled the start of the grand Etrian Odyssey series. How will the newest generation of explorers fare in unearthing Etria’s latest tale?",
