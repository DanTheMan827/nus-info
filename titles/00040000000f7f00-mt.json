This time, Mark Evans and the rest of the Inazuma National team face the tall order of reigning supreme in the Frontier International Championships – and they also have to deal with a futuristic enemy that has travelled back in time to threaten the very existence of football! 80 years in the future, Mark Evans’ great-grandson Canon Evans encounters Team Ogre, who plan to travel back 80 years and defeat Inazuma National on the football field to change the course of history, which in their evil minds means creating a world without football! In order to foil these potentially devastating plans, Canon must come face to face with Mark so that they can work together to preserve the fate of the beautiful game, all while ensuring that Inazuma National remains on course to be crowned the greatest football team in the world.
