	"description": "Join the Battle! Destroy the Enemies! Win the War! 3D tank battle action returns! Like before, maneuver your tank with the Circle Pad and aim & shoot with the stylus. This time, there are two types of tanks--the attack type with its powerful offensive capabilities, and the defense type with its impregnable defenses. The attack type improves upon the original charge shot with the ultimate weapon--the super charge shot. It cuts a swath of devastation through any armor. The defense type features a shield that bounces back any attack. The hostiles have added new weapons like wave shots, scatter shots, lasers, and drills. Hover units unaffected by the terrain and a cloaking stealth system have also been added. Gargantuan tanks have also joined the enemy's forces. The original's weapon systems are back too, like ricochet, homing, and mortar-type shots. There are 90 stages in all (60 regular and 30 bonus stages)--20 more than the previous game. Strap yourself in and gear up for an intense, futuristic tank shooting war--the original was only the beginning.",
