	"description": "This time, there are two types of tanks--the attack tank with its powerful offensive capabilities, and the defense tank with its impregnable defenses. The attack tank improves upon the original charge shot with the ultimate weapon--the super charge shot. It cuts a swath of devastation through any armor. The defense tank features a shield that bounces back any attack. The hostiles have added new weapons like wave shots, scatter shots, lasers, and drills. Hover units unaffected by the terrain and a cloaking stealth system have also been added. Gargantuan tanks have also joined the enemy's forces. The original's weapon systems are back too, like ricochet, homing, and mortar-type shots. There are 90 stages in all (60 regular and 30 bonus stages)--20 more than the previous game. Strap yourself in and gear up for an intense, futuristic tank shooting war--the original was only the beginning.",
