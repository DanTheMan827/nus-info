	"description": "Offers in-game purchases Hiking your way through the mountains one day, you become caught in an unexpected snowstorm, and find shelter with the help of a faint voice. When you awaken, you find and help a kindly Harvest Sprite buried under the snow, who tells you all of the seasons in the valley have vanished except for winter. To return all 4 seasons to the valley, you'll need the help of the villagers, the Harvest Sprites, the Harvest Goddess, and even the King of the Underworld! You've never played a Harvest Moon game quite like this! The first Harvest Moon game with a fully three-dimensional setting, allowing players to dig, stack, and till the soil any way they like!
