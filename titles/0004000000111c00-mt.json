	"description": "Yoshi’s New Island is the first instalment in this series since Yoshi’s Island DS was released in 2006. Yoshi’s good old Flutter Jump, Ground Pound and egg-throwing return, along with new abilities and challenges that take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS. You can use massive eggs called Mega-Eggs to destroy blocks and pipes, revealing secrets such as coins and hidden keys. The more things you destroy, the higher the Mega-Egg gauge goes, netting you extra lives in the process! The beautiful art is based on many classic styles, such as oil painting, watercolours and crayon drawings.",
