	"description": "Finn and Jake wake up one morning to find their trash stolen by the Ice King! Jake couldn’t care less about half-eaten bananas and old chicken diapers – but when the Ice King uses these stolen goods to construct a Garbage Princess, our heroes embark on a fantastical adventure and teach him a lesson! Journey through the Land of Ooo in an offbeat adventure to discover perilous dungeons, unimaginable treasures, the true meaning of friendship, and never-ending fun! Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why’d you steal our garbage?!! is the first video game based on the radical, Emmy nominated Cartoon Network show about two close friends – Jake, a wise old dog with a big heart, and Finn, a silly kid who wants to become a great hero. Adventure Time show creator Pendleton Ward is heavily involved with the game creation, including the design of a brand new storyline, concept, and quests.",
