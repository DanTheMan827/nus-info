	"description": "The hit animated 3D series BearShark, a CollegeHumor original exclusively on Nintendo Video, has inspired a game! Run, jump and swim for your life, because the top predators of land and sea are hot on your heels! Play as Steve, last of his bloodline, the chosen one. Chosen by Bear and Shark, because they're hungry! Steve is on an epic journey, cursed by The Programmers to run forever in an endless gauntlet that defies all known hope and logic. Also, get wet and wild with underwater sections! Brand new, never-before-seen \"score\" feature keeps track of \"numbers.\" Use Steve's trademark \"jump\" to avoid dangerous obstacles, like rocks, puffer fish and the diabolical machinations of Bear and Shark. Also, eat cupcakes you find in the woods & floating in the lake. Race for infinity as you ask the question on everyone's mind: Why are Bear and Shark chasing you? Are you the bad guy? What have you done? WHAT DID YOU DO? Make up your own backstory to this never-ending adventure and find out! When Bear and Shark team up, no one is safe.",
