	"description": "On a normal, uneventful day, a bell suddenly rings with an eerie sound. The sound led 18 Persona-users to a certain school. There, they were greeted by a never-ending festival... In the midst of the students enjoying the festival were Shadows, creatures which feed upon peopleâ€™s psyches. And there seems to be no exit from the school... The trapped Persona-users meet Zen and Rei, students who have lost their memories. As they decide to work together to escape this world, a mysterious figure lurks... The casts of Persona 3 and Persona 4 have transcended time and space to meet. Can they solve the mysteries of this world and return to their own...?",
