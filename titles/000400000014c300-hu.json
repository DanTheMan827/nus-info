	"description": "This demo offers four characters and one stage to battle with, but unlike a regular demo, there’s no limit to the number of times you can play it. And because four people can battle together via local wireless connection, you and your friends can all start practising combos and strategies for the full game, out October 3rd 2014. Not only that, but any gold collected in the demo can also be carried over to the full game, where it can be used to purchase in-game trophies, among other things.",
