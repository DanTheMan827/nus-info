	"description": "Updated: Now with multiplayer! Local Play and Internet with Friends. Battleminer is an open-world block game set in a world where giant, mutant Ants have taken over. Your mission is to rescue Survivors that are hostage to the Ants. A rescued Survivor will reward you with items or teach you the ability to craft new items yourself. While exploring the world you can mine for resources such as wood, copper, zinc and other materials to craft items to help you survive. As you progress you will encounter many different types of Ants, each with their own challenges for the player. There is also a Creative Mode where you can build your own structures and share screenshots of them via Miiverse™. The game features the first procedural voxel world with an infinite map size on the Nintendo 3DS™. Battleminer supports Stereoscopic 3D and has a dynamic night and day cycle.",
