	"description": "Sonic the Hedgehog is here to save the day, and this time he’s got help from his friend Miles \"Tails\" Prower! Dr. Eggman (AKA Dr. Robotnik) is back and is planning on building his ultimate weapon, the Death Egg. To do so, he’s going to turn the animal inhabitants of Mobius into his own personal army of Badniks. Can Sonic obtain the 7 Chaos Emeralds and stop him once and for all? 3D Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is remastered in 3D and full of new features! Is the Chemical Plant Zone your favorite stage? Use “Stage Select” and start running wherever you want! Run fast without worrying about your rings. Cut your losses by choosing Ring Keeper Mode—only half your rings will be lost after taking damage! Keeping your rings and stopping Dr. Eggman’s evil scheme is important, but don’t forget to take some time off from saving the world to play against your friends in the 2 Player VS and CO-OP Mode using Local Play!
