	"description": "Residing on the outskirts of town as the proprietor of a quiet, rustic inn, Luchs has lived through much of his life proudly clinging to a code of honour passed down from father to son for generations: \"When our cherished guests finally arrive, think of them as nothing less than family.\" Unfortunately, the inn has not yet had even a single guest since its foundation, leaving Luchs no choice but to excavate and sell crystals — the island’s most valuable fuel source — in order to make ends meet. It is during one such routine excavation that he happens upon a beautiful maiden encased inside a massive crystal, and her abrupt awakening triggers a series of unexpected events that include foul fiends, astonishing abilities, and miraculous mysteries... Features: Seven Heroines, Seven Stories - Each of the seven heroines who come to inhabit the inn have their own stories to tell, and building relationships with them will unlock new, specialised attacks to aid in combat when they join the battle party. Strategic Combat Makes Every Turn Count - \"Bowl\" over as many enemies with a single strike as possible, challenging players to line up melee, ranged and magical attacks so frontline enemies are knocked into others for maximum collateral damage. Craft Your Way to New Skills - In addition to unlocking new abilities, participating in Free Battles and registering for Street Pass™ can provide rare crafting items for use in creating new skills to help turn the tides of battle. Adjustable Difficulty Levels and More - Players can toggle among Easy, Normal and Hard difficulties, use the Fast Forward feature to speed up combat as desired, or relive fond memories via in-game movie and art galleries.",
