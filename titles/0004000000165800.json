		"description": "SENRAN KAGURA 2: Deep Crimson is the latest Nintendo 3DS™ title in the infamous SENRAN KAGURA franchise. For those who aren’t familiar, expect a fast-paced beat ‘em up game with insane combo chains, plenty of playable characters, hilarious cutscenes and an abundance of tantalising action! The game picks up directly where its Nintendo 3DS™ predecessor SENRAN KAGURA Burst left off, and follows the Hanzo & Hebijo Shinobi Academies as they battle for good and evil respectively. This time however there is a greater evil at work, as the tyrannous tycoon behind the Hebijo Academy is hell-bent on raining terror across all of Japan by utilising a destructive army of summoned demons! This great danger thrusts the girls together and forces them to unite and work as one in a way the series has never seen before. FEATURES: Pair Battles For the first time ever, two shinobi warriors from opposing academies must fight together, and the dual character combo system allows for spectacular and devastating joint attacks. Improved graphics and stellar audio The graphical improvement from ‘Burst’ is dramatic, with full 3D environments, improved animations and a better framerate! This is combined with original Japanese voice-overs to create a gorgeous experience all-round. Local & Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Co-op mode For the first time on Nintendo 3DS™, two players will be able to join forces and play the story or special missions together via ad hoc multiplayer or online. Improved Dressing Room The dressing room is stocked with hundreds of items, and this time up to two shinobi can be present in the dressing room at once! Also, for the very first time in the series you can pose the girls in a variety of positions, and even pose them in real life environments using the Nintendo 3DS™’ built-in camera!",

		"description": "SENRAN KAGURA 2: Deep Crimson est le dernier titre pour la Nintendo 3DS™ de la fameuse franchise SENRAN KAGURA. Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas ce jeu, attendez-vous à un beat them up intense avec des enchaînements de combos de folie, de nombreux personnages jouables, des cinématiques hilarantes et une tonne d'action aguichante! Le jeu reprend directement où SENRAN KAGURA Burst, son prédécesseur sur la Nintendo 3DS™, s'était arrêté, et suit l'histoire des académies de Shinobi Hanzo et Hebijo dans leur lutte pour le bien et le mal, respectivement. Un mal encore plus terrible est à l'œuvre cette fois-ci, et le tyrannique magnat responsable de l'Académie Hebijo veut à tout prix répandre la terreur sur le Japon grâce à son armée destructrice de démons ! Les filles sont plongées au cœur du danger, les obligeant à unir leurs forces et à collaborer comme jamais auparavant dans la série. FEATURES: Batailles par paire Pour la première fois, deux guerriers shinobis d'académies adverses doivent unir leurs forces, et le système de combo à deux personnages permet d'effectuer des attaques conjointes spectaculaires et dévastatrices. Des graphismes améliorés et d'extraordinaires effets audio L'amélioration graphique de « Burst » est spectaculaire, avec ses environnements entièrement en 3D, l'amélioration de ses animations et un meilleur framerate ! Tout ceci associé aux voix japonaises originales afin de créer une magnifique expérience en tout point. Mode coop local et Nintendo WiFi Pour la première fois dans la série, deux joueurs pourront joindre leurs forces pour suivre l'histoire ou effectuer les missions spéciales ensemble via le mode multijoueur ad hoc ou en ligne. Amélioration du Dressing Room Le Dressing Room est rempli de centaines d'objets, et jusqu'à deux shinobis peuvent désormais y être présents simultanément ! Et pour la première fois dans la série, vous pouvez faire poser les filles dans de nombreuses positions, et même les faire poser dans des environnements réels grâce à la caméra intégrée de la Nintendo 3DS™ !",

		"description": "SENRAN KAGURA 2: Deep Crimson est le dernier titre pour la Nintendo 3DS™ de la fameuse franchise SENRAN KAGURA. Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas ce jeu, attendez-vous à un beat them up intense avec des enchaînements de combos de folie, de nombreux personnages jouables, des cinématiques hilarantes et une tonne d'action aguichante! Le jeu reprend directement où SENRAN KAGURA Burst, son prédécesseur sur la Nintendo 3DS™, s'était arrêté, et suit l'histoire des académies de Shinobi Hanzo et Hebijo dans leur lutte pour le bien et le mal, respectivement. Un mal encore plus terrible est à l'œuvre cette fois-ci, et le tyrannique magnat responsable de l'Académie Hebijo veut à tout prix répandre la terreur sur le Japon grâce à son armée destructrice de démons ! Les filles sont plongées au cœur du danger, les obligeant à unir leurs forces et à collaborer comme jamais auparavant dans la série. FEATURES: Batailles par paire Pour la première fois, deux guerriers shinobis d'académies adverses doivent unir leurs forces, et le système de combo à deux personnages permet d'effectuer des attaques conjointes spectaculaires et dévastatrices. Des graphismes améliorés et d'extraordinaires effets audio L'amélioration graphique de « Burst » est spectaculaire, avec ses environnements entièrement en 3D, l'amélioration de ses animations et un meilleur framerate ! Tout ceci associé aux voix japonaises originales afin de créer une magnifique expérience en tout point. Mode coop local et Nintendo WiFi Pour la première fois dans la série, deux joueurs pourront joindre leurs forces pour suivre l'histoire ou effectuer les missions spéciales ensemble via le mode multijoueur ad hoc ou en ligne. Amélioration du Dressing Room Le Dressing Room est rempli de centaines d'objets, et jusqu'à deux shinobis peuvent désormais y être présents simultanément ! Et pour la première fois dans la série, vous pouvez faire poser les filles dans de nombreuses positions, et même les faire poser dans des environnements réels grâce à la caméra intégrée de la Nintendo 3DS™ !",

		"description": "SENRAN KAGURA 2: Deep Crimson is the latest Nintendo 3DS™ title in the infamous SENRAN KAGURA franchise. For those who aren’t familiar, expect a fast-paced beat ‘em up game with insane combo chains, plenty of playable characters, hilarious cutscenes and an abundance of tantalising action! The game picks up directly where its Nintendo 3DS™ predecessor SENRAN KAGURA Burst left off, and follows the Hanzo & Hebijo Shinobi Academies as they battle for good and evil respectively. This time however there is a greater evil at work, as the tyrannous tycoon behind the Hebijo Academy is hell-bent on raining terror across all of Japan by utilising a destructive army of summoned demons! This great danger thrusts the girls together and forces them to unite and work as one in a way the series has never seen before. FEATURES: Pair Battles For the first time ever, two shinobi warriors from opposing academies must fight together, and the dual character combo system allows for spectacular and devastating joint attacks. Improved graphics and stellar audio The graphical improvement from ‘Burst’ is dramatic, with full 3D environments, improved animations and a better framerate! This is combined with original Japanese voice-overs to create a gorgeous experience all-round. Local & Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Co-op mode For the first time on Nintendo 3DS™, two players will be able to join forces and play the story or special missions together via ad hoc multiplayer or online. Improved Dressing Room The dressing room is stocked with hundreds of items, and this time up to two shinobi can be present in the dressing room at once! Also, for the very first time in the series you can pose the girls in a variety of positions, and even pose them in real life environments using the Nintendo 3DS™’ built-in camera!",

		"description": "SENRAN KAGURA 2: Deep Crimson is the latest Nintendo 3DS™ title in the infamous SENRAN KAGURA franchise. For those who aren’t familiar, expect a fast-paced beat ‘em up game with insane combo chains, plenty of playable characters, hilarious cutscenes and an abundance of tantalising action! The game picks up directly where its Nintendo 3DS™ predecessor SENRAN KAGURA Burst left off, and follows the Hanzo & Hebijo Shinobi Academies as they battle for good and evil respectively. This time however there is a greater evil at work, as the tyrannous tycoon behind the Hebijo Academy is hell-bent on raining terror across all of Japan by utilising a destructive army of summoned demons! This great danger thrusts the girls together and forces them to unite and work as one in a way the series has never seen before. FEATURES: Pair Battles For the first time ever, two shinobi warriors from opposing academies must fight together, and the dual character combo system allows for spectacular and devastating joint attacks. Improved graphics and stellar audio The graphical improvement from ‘Burst’ is dramatic, with full 3D environments, improved animations and a better framerate! This is combined with original Japanese voice-overs to create a gorgeous experience all-round. Local & Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Co-op mode For the first time on Nintendo 3DS™, two players will be able to join forces and play the story or special missions together via ad hoc multiplayer or online. Improved Dressing Room The dressing room is stocked with hundreds of items, and this time up to two shinobi can be present in the dressing room at once! Also, for the very first time in the series you can pose the girls in a variety of positions, and even pose them in real life environments using the Nintendo 3DS™’ built-in camera!",

		"description": "SENRAN KAGURA 2: Deep Crimson est le dernier titre pour la Nintendo 3DS™ de la fameuse franchise SENRAN KAGURA. Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas ce jeu, attendez-vous à un beat them up intense avec des enchaînements de combos de folie, de nombreux personnages jouables, des cinématiques hilarantes et une tonne d'action aguichante! Le jeu reprend directement où SENRAN KAGURA Burst, son prédécesseur sur la Nintendo 3DS™, s'était arrêté, et suit l'histoire des académies de Shinobi Hanzo et Hebijo dans leur lutte pour le bien et le mal, respectivement. Un mal encore plus terrible est à l'œuvre cette fois-ci, et le tyrannique magnat responsable de l'Académie Hebijo veut à tout prix répandre la terreur sur le Japon grâce à son armée destructrice de démons ! Les filles sont plongées au cœur du danger, les obligeant à unir leurs forces et à collaborer comme jamais auparavant dans la série. FEATURES: Batailles par paire Pour la première fois, deux guerriers shinobis d'académies adverses doivent unir leurs forces, et le système de combo à deux personnages permet d'effectuer des attaques conjointes spectaculaires et dévastatrices. Des graphismes améliorés et d'extraordinaires effets audio L'amélioration graphique de « Burst » est spectaculaire, avec ses environnements entièrement en 3D, l'amélioration de ses animations et un meilleur framerate ! Tout ceci associé aux voix japonaises originales afin de créer une magnifique expérience en tout point. Mode coop local et Nintendo WiFi Pour la première fois dans la série, deux joueurs pourront joindre leurs forces pour suivre l'histoire ou effectuer les missions spéciales ensemble via le mode multijoueur ad hoc ou en ligne. Amélioration du Dressing Room Le Dressing Room est rempli de centaines d'objets, et jusqu'à deux shinobis peuvent désormais y être présents simultanément ! Et pour la première fois dans la série, vous pouvez faire poser les filles dans de nombreuses positions, et même les faire poser dans des environnements réels grâce à la caméra intégrée de la Nintendo 3DS™ !",

		"description": "SENRAN KAGURA 2: Deep Crimson is the latest Nintendo 3DS™ title in the infamous SENRAN KAGURA franchise. For those who aren’t familiar, expect a fast-paced beat ‘em up game with insane combo chains, plenty of playable characters, hilarious cutscenes and an abundance of tantalising action! The game picks up directly where its Nintendo 3DS™ predecessor SENRAN KAGURA Burst left off, and follows the Hanzo & Hebijo Shinobi Academies as they battle for good and evil respectively. This time however there is a greater evil at work, as the tyrannous tycoon behind the Hebijo Academy is hell-bent on raining terror across all of Japan by utilising a destructive army of summoned demons! This great danger thrusts the girls together and forces them to unite and work as one in a way the series has never seen before. FEATURES: Pair Battles For the first time ever, two shinobi warriors from opposing academies must fight together, and the dual character combo system allows for spectacular and devastating joint attacks. Improved graphics and stellar audio The graphical improvement from ‘Burst’ is dramatic, with full 3D environments, improved animations and a better framerate! This is combined with original Japanese voice-overs to create a gorgeous experience all-round.

		"description": "SENRAN KAGURA 2: Deep Crimson is the latest Nintendo 3DS™ title in the infamous SENRAN KAGURA franchise. For those who aren’t familiar, expect a fast-paced beat ‘em up game with insane combo chains, plenty of playable characters, hilarious cutscenes and an abundance of tantalising action! The game picks up directly where its Nintendo 3DS™ predecessor SENRAN KAGURA Burst left off, and follows the Hanzo & Hebijo Shinobi Academies as they battle for good and evil respectively. This time however there is a greater evil at work, as the tyrannous tycoon behind the Hebijo Academy is hell-bent on raining terror across all of Japan by utilising a destructive army of summoned demons! This great danger thrusts the girls together and forces them to unite and work as one in a way the series has never seen before. FEATURES: Pair Battles For the first time ever, two shinobi warriors from opposing academies must fight together, and the dual character combo system allows for spectacular and devastating joint attacks. Improved graphics and stellar audio The graphical improvement from ‘Burst’ is dramatic, with full 3D environments, improved animations and a better framerate! This is combined with original Japanese voice-overs to create a gorgeous experience all-round. Local & Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Co-op mode For the first time on Nintendo 3DS™, two players will be able to join forces and play the story or special missions together via ad hoc multiplayer or online. Improved Dressing Room The dressing room is stocked with hundreds of items, and this time up to two shinobi can be present in the dressing room at once! Also, for the very first time in the series you can pose the girls in a variety of positions, and even pose them in real life environments using the Nintendo 3DS™’ built-in camera!",
