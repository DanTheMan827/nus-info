You’ll find the download code for the free theme on your Nintendo eShop receipt. Download codes available while supplies last. Let your voice take song. Defeat the Witch of Destruction and save the world in Stella Glow! For an entire millennium, the world has been devoid of “song” as a result of a savage war. Only 5 Witches left in the land are able to use “song magic.” However, Hilda the Witch of Destruction plans to eliminate the other Witches and the world with her curse of Crystallization. Alto and the Regnant Knights must now do all they can to stop Hilda, starting with recruiting the other Witches and using their power of song to break the curse. Befriend the Witches, dive into their Spirit Worlds, and defeat the enemies causing their inner turmoil to level up their powers! Magic, weapons, and superior tactics are necessary to get through the barrage of enemies you’ll discover. In addition to combat, make sure to plan out your tasks during free time. Balance combat and free time in game, as both are necessary to advance the story! Make your choices wisely and save the world!",
