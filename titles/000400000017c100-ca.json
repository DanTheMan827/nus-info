	"description": "Pokémon Picross is a puzzle game where you reveal a hidden Pokémon illustration. Once you solve an illustration of a Pokémon, you can collect that Pokémon. Collected Pokémon help you solve more difficult puzzles. With 300+ standard Pokémon puzzles, a significantly harder advanced mode, and Daily Training, this game will supply hours of enjoyment. Pokémon Picross is a free-to-start downloadable puzzle game that’s easy to pick up and hard to put down. During gameplay, use numbers on each horizontal and vertical row as your guide to reveal a Pokémon portrait. When you reveal a Pokémon picture you’ll collect that Pokémon. Add a collected Pokémon to your party and you can use its support skills. Picrites are stones with magical power. You can obtain them in various ways during your gameplay to access more features and more areas. Picrites may also be purchased with funds from your Nintendo eShop account. Purchasing Picrites isn’t required to play or enjoy this title.",
