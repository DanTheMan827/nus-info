Le jeu offre une nouvelle mécanique qui combine l'essence des jeux de plateforme avec une belle mise en scène basée sur des éléments et des références artistiques. Le but du jeu est de libérer le baron Von Sottendorff de sa propre folie et pour y parvenir il nous faudra surmonter divers obstacles qui surgiront sur le chemin. En franchissant les différents niveaux, divers objets permettront de débloquer des souvenirs clés dans la vie du baron Von Sottendorff. Plus nous obtiendrons de souvenirs et plus nous serons en mesure de lui faire retrouver la raison. Devenons fous et aidons le baron à retrouver la raison. Mais attention... Les pièces du manoir se déplacent et il est très facile de se perdre définitivement dans son univers.",

Le jeu offre une nouvelle mécanique qui combine l'essence des jeux de plateforme avec une belle mise en scène basée sur des éléments et des références artistiques. Le but du jeu est de libérer le baron Von Sottendorff de sa propre folie et pour y parvenir il nous faudra surmonter divers obstacles qui surgiront sur le chemin. En franchissant les différents niveaux, divers objets permettront de débloquer des souvenirs clés dans la vie du baron Von Sottendorff. Plus nous obtiendrons de souvenirs et plus nous serons en mesure de lui faire retrouver la raison. Devenons fous et aidons le baron à retrouver la raison. Mais attention... Les pièces du manoir se déplacent et il est très facile de se perdre définitivement dans son univers.",

		"description": "Baron Von Sottendorff is an aristocrat in the early 20th century. He doesn't know it, but he is really living trapped in a grid drawing of his mansion, created by his own lunatic mind. The game has a new focus that combines the essence of gaming platforms with puzzles in a beautiful scenery created from artistic elements and references. The objective of the game is to free Baron Von Sottendorff from his own madness; to do this, you must overcome the challenges that appear along the way. As you solve the different levels, you receive objects that will help you unlock memories from his life. The more memories you get, the closer you are to regaining his sanity. Go crazy and help the Baron get his sanity back! But be careful...the rooms of the mansion move about and it's easy to get lost in his world.",
