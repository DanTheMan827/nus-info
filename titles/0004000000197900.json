Do everything you find necessary so you can end their lives. - Retro style: Like many of our games, Defend Your Crypt will have retro pixel art. In addition, we will lean toward Egyptian style. - Trap variety: The game will contain classic traps such as open platforms, which can make robbers fall onto spikes, and also water traps or killer scorpions and beetles. - Gore: In Ratalaika Games, we know you like blood, so we have included it. A lot of it. Killing the robbers won't be enough. \"If it bleeds, we can kill it\", and we're taking it to the limit. (If you don't like blood, you can deactivate it :P) - Levels: A large number of levels to make sure the robbers will not steal any of your gold, and you enjoy the game to the fullest. A lot of time can be spent on finishing all of them! - Robbers with feelings: No robbers are heartless. Throughout the game, players will see robbers in different moods, and they will also interact with each other a little bit. Seeing a hallway full of blood could make a robber sad and break his heart.

		"description": "Defend Your Crypt est un jeu de stratégie et de réflexion dans lequel vous devez éviter de perdre votre trésor aux mains des voleurs. Vous, en tant que Pharaon, pouvez utiliser différents pièges pour éloigner ces humains qui profanent votre tombe. Laissez les tomber dans le vide, brûlez les vif, transpercez les de fleches, noyez-les, envoyer leur vos scorpions ... Faites le nécessaire pour en finir avec leurs vies. - Retro style: Comme beaucoup de nos jeux, Defend Your Crypt est un jeu en retro pixel art. De plus nous tendons vers le style égyptien. - Variété de pièges: Le jeu va contenir des pièges classiques tel que les plateformes ouvertes qui vont faire tomber les voleurs sur des piques, ainsi que des pieges d'eau, de scorpions meutriers et de coléoptères. - Gore: Dans les jeux de Ratalaika Games, nous savons que vous aimez le sang, donc on en a mis plein. Mais vraiment plein. Tuer les voleurs ne va pas être suffisant. Si ca saigne, on peut le tuer, et nous surpassons nos limites ! (si vous n'aimez pas vous pouvez toujours désactiver cette fonction :p) - Niveaux: Un grand nombre de niveaux pour être sur que les voleurs ne déroberont pas votre trésor, et que vous puissiez profiter du jeu à son plein potentiel. Beaucoup de temps à été consacré aux finitions de ceux-ci ! - Voleurs qui ont des sentiments: Aucun voleur n'est sans coeur. Tout au long du jeu, les joueurs vont voir les voleurs agir de façons bien différentes, ils vont aussi interragir entres eux. Voir un couloir plein de sang rendra un voleur triste et lui briser le coeur. ",

		"description": "Defend Your Crypt es un juego de puzzles y estrategia en el que tendremos que evitar que los ladrones de tumbas se hagan con nuestro tesoro. Nosotros como faraón podemos usar varias trampas diferentes para deshacernos de esos malditos humanos ambiciosos que no les importa profanar tu tumba. Déjales caer al vacío , quémalos, atraviésalos con una flecha, ahógalos, manda tus escorpiones a por ellos. Haz todo lo que encuentres necesario con el fin de acabar con sus vidas. - Estilo Retro: Como gran parte de nuestros juegos, Defend Your Crypt también tendrá un estilo pixel retro. Intentando además conseguir una estética egipcia más que interesante. - Variedad de trampas: El juego cuenta con trampas clásicas como pueden ser plataformas que se abren para dejar caer a los ladrones o pinchos, pasando por trampas de agua hasta llegar a escarabajos y escorpiones asesinos. Ah y lanzallamas, !Eso no puede faltar! - Gore: En Ratalaika Games sabemos que os gusta ver sangre, así que hemos incorporado sangre, mucha, no será suficiente con solo matarlos. \"Si sangra, podemos matarlo\", así que eso lo llevamos al límite. (Si no os gusta la sangre, también podéis desactivarla :P) - Niveles: Como buen faraón, tenías muchas criptas ocultas de las que casi nadie tenía conocimiento. Así que prepárate para aniquilar todo ladrón existente a lo largo de una gran cantidad de niveles. - Ladrones con sentimientos: Todo ladrón tiene su corazón. A lo largo del juego veremos estados de ánimo en los ladrones y pequeñas interacciones entre ellos. Así que cuidado si dejamos un reguero de sangre en un pasillo, el ladrón podría entristecerse y harías pedacitos su corazón. ",

Laissez les tomber dans le vide, brûlez les vif, transpercez les de fleches, noyez-les, envoyer leur vos scorpions ... Faites le nécessaire pour en finir avec leurs vies. - Retro style: Comme beaucoup de nos jeux, Defend Your Crypt est un jeu en retro pixel art. De plus nous tendons vers le style égyptien. - Variété de pièges: Le jeu va contenir des pièges classiques tel que les plateformes ouvertes qui vont faire tomber les voleurs sur des piques, ainsi que des pieges d'eau, de scorpions meutriers et de coléoptères. - Gore: Dans les jeux de Ratalaika Games, nous savons que vous aimez le sang, donc on en a mis plein. Mais vraiment plein. Tuer les voleurs ne va pas être suffisant. Si ca saigne, on peut le tuer, et nous surpassons nos limites ! (si vous n'aimez pas vous pouvez toujours désactiver cette fonction :p) - Niveaux: Un grand nombre de niveaux pour être sur que les voleurs ne déroberont pas votre trésor, et que vous puissiez profiter du jeu à son plein potentiel. Beaucoup de temps à été consacré aux finitions de ceux-ci ! - Voleurs qui ont des sentiments: Aucun voleur n'est sans coeur. Tout au long du jeu, les joueurs vont voir les voleurs agir de façons bien différentes, ils vont aussi interragir entres eux. Voir un couloir plein de sang rendra un voleur triste et lui briser le coeur. ",

		"description": "Defend Your Crypt is a strategy and puzzle game, in which we will have to avoid to lose our treasure by the tomb thieves. We, as the Pharaoh, can use different traps to defeat those damn ambitious humans who are profaning your tomb. Let them fall into the void, burn them, put an arrow through them, drown them, send your scorpions to kill them... Do everything you find necessary so you can end their lives. - Retro style: Like many of our games, Defend Your Crypt will have retro pixel art. In addition, we will lean toward Egyptian style. - Trap variety: The game will contain classic traps such as open platforms, which can make robbers fall onto spikes, and also water traps or killer scorpions and beetles. - Gore: In Ratalaika Games, we know you like blood, so we have included it. A lot of it. Killing the robbers won't be enough. \"If it bleeds, we can kill it\", and we're taking it to the limit. (If you don't like blood, you can deactivate it :P) - Levels: A large number of levels to make sure the robbers will not steal any of your gold, and you enjoy the game to the fullest. A lot of time can be spent on finishing all of them! - Robbers with feelings: No robbers are heartless. Throughout the game, players will see robbers in different moods, and they will also interact with each other a little bit. Seeing a hallway full of blood could make a robber sad and break his heart.",

		"description": "Defend Your Crypt est un jeu de stratégie et de réflexion dans lequel vous devez éviter de perdre votre trésor aux mains des voleurs. Vous, en tant que Pharaon, pouvez utiliser différents pièges pour éloigner ces humains qui profanent votre tombe. Laissez les tomber dans le vide, brûlez les vif, transpercez les de fleches, noyez-les, envoyer leur vos scorpions ... Faites le nécessaire pour en finir avec leurs vies. - Retro style: Comme beaucoup de nos jeux, Defend Your Crypt est un jeu en retro pixel art. De plus nous tendons vers le style égyptien. - Variété de pièges: Le jeu va contenir des pièges classiques tel que les plateformes ouvertes qui vont faire tomber les voleurs sur des piques, ainsi que des pieges d'eau, de scorpions meutriers et de coléoptères. - Gore: Dans les jeux de Ratalaika Games, nous savons que vous aimez le sang, donc on en a mis plein. Mais vraiment plein. Tuer les voleurs ne va pas être suffisant. Si ca saigne, on peut le tuer, et nous surpassons nos limites ! (si vous n'aimez pas vous pouvez toujours désactiver cette fonction :p) - Niveaux: Un grand nombre de niveaux pour être sur que les voleurs ne déroberont pas votre trésor, et que vous puissiez profiter du jeu à son plein potentiel. Beaucoup de temps à été consacré aux finitions de ceux-ci ! - Voleurs qui ont des sentiments: Aucun voleur n'est sans coeur. Tout au long du jeu, les joueurs vont voir les voleurs agir de façons bien différentes, ils vont aussi interragir entres eux. Voir un couloir plein de sang rendra un voleur triste et lui briser le coeur. ",

A lot of it. Killing the robbers won't be enough. \"If it bleeds, we can kill it\", and we're taking it to the limit. (If you don't like blood, you can deactivate it :P) - Levels: A large number of levels to make sure the robbers will not steal any of your gold, and you enjoy the game to the fullest. A lot of time can be spent on finishing all of them! - Robbers with feelings: No robbers are heartless. Throughout the game, players will see robbers in different moods, and they will also interact with each other a little bit. Seeing a hallway full of blood could make a robber sad and break his heart.",
