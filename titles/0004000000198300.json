Pour l'aider à faire face à ce mouvement, sa amie Ayumi a mis au point un plan apparemment innocent : l'ensemble du groupe se réuniront pour effectuer un charme qu'elle a trouvé sur l'Internet appelé \"Sachiko Ever After,\" qui est censé lier tous ses participants ensemble comme des amis à la fin. Cela ne va pas comme prévu. Après un tremblement de terre intense, le groupe se réveille pour se trouver séparés et piégés dans une version alternative de la réalité du Heavenly Host Elementary School, une institution, avec une histoire tragique, qui se trouvait sur le site de leur propre école, mais a été démoli il y a longtemps. Ici, les esprits vengeurs des enfants d'âge primaire menacent leur vie et leur santé mentale, et le seul espoir de survivre - et peut-être échapper - est de découvrir les détails effrayant de entourant les meurtres de ceux qui sont piégés devant eux.",

Pour l'aider à faire face à ce mouvement, sa amie Ayumi a mis au point un plan apparemment innocent : l'ensemble du groupe se réuniront pour effectuer un charme qu'elle a trouvé sur l'Internet appelé \"Sachiko Ever After,\" qui est censé lier tous ses participants ensemble comme des amis à la fin. Cela ne va pas comme prévu. Après un tremblement de terre intense, le groupe se réveille pour se trouver séparés et piégés dans une version alternative de la réalité du Heavenly Host Elementary School, une institution, avec une histoire tragique, qui se trouvait sur le site de leur propre école, mais a été démoli il y a longtemps. Ici, les esprits vengeurs des enfants d'âge primaire menacent leur vie et leur santé mentale, et le seul espoir de survivre - et peut-être échapper - est de découvrir les détails effrayant de entourant les meurtres de ceux qui sont piégés devant eux.",

Pour l'aider à faire face à ce mouvement, sa amie Ayumi a mis au point un plan apparemment innocent : l'ensemble du groupe se réuniront pour effectuer un charme qu'elle a trouvé sur l'Internet appelé \"Sachiko Ever After,\" qui est censé lier tous ses participants ensemble comme des amis à la fin. Cela ne va pas comme prévu. Après un tremblement de terre intense, le groupe se réveille pour se trouver séparés et piégés dans une version alternative de la réalité du Heavenly Host Elementary School, une institution, avec une histoire tragique, qui se trouvait sur le site de leur propre école, mais a été démoli il y a longtemps. Ici, les esprits vengeurs des enfants d'âge primaire menacent leur vie et leur santé mentale, et le seul espoir de survivre - et peut-être échapper - est de découvrir les détails effrayant de entourant les meurtres de ceux qui sont piégés devant eux.",

To help her cope with this move, her friend Ayumi has devised a seemingly innocent plan: the whole group will come together to perform a charm she found on the internet called “Sachiko Ever After,” which is supposed to bind all of its participants together as friends to the end. This does not go as expected. Following an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary School, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago. Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of survival - much less escape - is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them.",
