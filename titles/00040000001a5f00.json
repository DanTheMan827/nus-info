Conecte-se com um jogador que tenha a versão completa para jogar os modos de multijogador com até três outros jogadores. Não importa como você faz a festa, a diversão é instantânea para todo mundo! Sem ter que esperar sua vez, escolha seu caminho para a vitória em Toad Scramble. Você e até três amigos jogam dados, percorrem o tabuleiro e recrutam aliados favoritos dos fãs, como Yoshi™, Daisy™, e Waluigi™! Quanto maior seu grupo, mais rápido é obter estrelas e moedas em minijogos. Use suas habilidades contra amigos em Coinathlon, ou percorra o tabuleiro em Balloon Bash. Ao jogar os modos de multijogador, você desbloqueia bônus do modo individual, como Goomba Gold Rush, que lhe permite lançar inimigos em canhões, e um museu onde personagens podem ser adicionados ao tocar com uma figura amiibo™ compatível. Fazer festa é trabalho sério!",
