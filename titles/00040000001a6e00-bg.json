	"description": "The 2D high speed, old-school style side-scrolling action that you remember from Azure Striker Gunvolt is back! In this game, Gunvolt's rival Copen from the first installment returns to the fray as a playable character! Gameplay Features: 1. Prevasion This ability allows Gunvolt to neutralize enemy attacks at the cost of his EP energy. Copen also has an ability exactly like this. 2. Kudos Kudos is a point system that increases whenever you deal damage to an enemy. Whenever you take damage, your Kudos are reduced to zero. When activating a save point, using a special skill or clearing a mission, Kudos are converted into bonus points. 3. The Muse's song For as long as you can maintain 1000 or more Kudos, the BGM will change and Lumen AKA The Muse (or in Copen's story, Lola) will sing for you! 4. Anthem When Gunvolt or Copen's HP reaches 0, the Muse's power can bring them back to life, with additional power-ups. In that state, the BGM will change to the Muse's song.",
