	"description": "What is Kutar? Kutar is the character who has incredible expressionless emotions that can't be distinguished by laughing or crying. Kutar is not a dog, cat or bear. Kutar is always Kutar no matter where he is going or doing. Though being so expressionless, when Kutar wants to laugh, cry, love or be angry, all feelings are still very ordinary. No matter what happens, the emotions will not change. Even when a desperate situation arrives, Kutar will just inflate his body and overcome. What a wonderful Yuru-chara. The lovely and funny Kutar game series is everywhere! Just finish the quest's challenges with simple controls. This time Kutar joins the tube riding match on the snowy field, the tires can only go ahead by bumping the convex ground to bounce.",
