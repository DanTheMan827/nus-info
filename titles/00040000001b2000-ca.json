	"description": "You've never played sudoku like this before. Two players, one puzzle! There are 1,000 exclusive puzzles to solve on your own, or co-operatively with a friend. Or if you feel like getting competitive, Party Mode lets you battle it out against an opponent to see who can think the quickest with unique fast-action gameplay. Solve a square and your opponent has only seconds to respond or the point is yours. When your opponent makes a move, you have to match it quickly or lose the square for good. Can you keep up? Or will you choose a different path, hoping to lock in more squares simply by thinking faster? Use Download Play to play with nearby friends using only one copy of the game, or go online to battle the next available opponent. Sudoku Party features 1,000 exclusive puzzles designed by Conceptis, the world's leading creator of logic puzzles.
