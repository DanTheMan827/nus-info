Les systèmes de jeu ont été entièrement rénovées et comprennent de nouvelles actions, telles qu'un système de personnalisation qui vous permet de façonner votre personnage un héros pour vous ! Et ce n'est pas tout ! Le nouveau système de Burst Combo vous récompense pour mettre fin à des ennemis et boss à proximité.

Os sistemas de jogo foram completamente renovados e incluem várias adições, tais como um sistema de personalização que te permite moldar o teu personagem num herói que melhor combina contigo! E isso não é tudo! O novo sistema Burst Combo recompensa-te por acabar com inimigos e bosses ao perto.

The game systems have been completely revamped and powered up with lots of new additions, including a deep character customization system that lets you mold and shape your character into the ultimate hero that works best for you!

The classic pixel style graphics have also been completely redone to blur the line between 8-bit and 16-bit and take you back to the golden age of 2D action games!",
