	"description": "Speed into the future with the first installment to the F-Zero™ series. Operated by their own designated racer, including the celebrated Captain Falcon, pick one of four proton-powered hover cars—each with its own acceleration curve and design modifications. Strategy will play a big part in this speed fest as you race across 15 courses filled with challenges and pitfalls. Find shortcuts, elude hazards, and snag power-ups if you want to beat the competition. Keep an eye out for sand, land mines, magnets, and other trouble spots, but always be ready for that boost from a speed or jump plate to get ahead. You'll need split-second reflexes to control these speed machines of tomorrow, so get ready for an experience that's out of this world!",
