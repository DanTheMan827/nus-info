		"description": "Robot Invader's popular action-platformer WIND-UP KNIGHT 2 springs to life on the New Nintendo 3DS system. Guide the clueless hero, Sir Sprint, as he rockets through the kingdom dodging traps, pits and mythical creatures. With striking graphics, a dose of humor, and some of the most clever and devious level designs ever, you'll laugh and cry at the same time. But watch out! This spring-loaded cavelier won't stop moving until he unwinds completely. And if that happens...game over. Your skills will be pushed to the absolute limits as you double jump, roll and slice your way through 40 crazy levels and an all new Tourney mode. Think you've got what it takes? Wind up and find out! ",
