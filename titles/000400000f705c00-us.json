	"description": "Purchase this game at full price through Nintendo eShop and get a free digital version of Futuridium EP Deluxe for Wii U. The same Nintendo Network ID must be linked to your Wii U and Nintendo 3DS systems as well as your eShop account prior to purchase in order to be eligible for the offer. Offer applies to US, Canada, and Mexico only Futuridium EP Deluxe is a psychedelic retro inspired shoot’em up with a modern twist, that blends together frantic action, puzzle elements, a vibrant low poly aesthetic and an heart pumping electronic soundtrack. As a lone starship pilot lost in a dimensional loop just before a big space battle, with a limited and constantly depleting energy tank, your only hope is to fly as fast as possible over enormous space dreadnoughts, destroying their defenses and the cyan power cubes to get some energy back. Try to escape the infinite loop of Futuridium: you can count only on your reflexes, your dual lasers, the nimbleness of your starship and... the ability to turn 180° on the spot! Can you beat all the 50 levels, the 5 bosses, unlock all the extra game modes and collect the 150 medals? Good luck! You’ll need it...",
