Si vous utilisez la fonction de handicap, vous pouvez faire correspondre le niveau des deux personnes. Parce que le temps de match-up est court, je peux jouer n'importe quand et n'importe où quand j'en ressens. Bien sûr, il existe également un mode de lecture 1P pour son temps.

Tous les deux partenaires, y compris les parents, les amis, les amoureux, etc. conviennent. Parce qu'il est simple et les règles que tout le monde sait, vous pouvez commencer le jeu immédiatement sur place. Si vous utilisez la fonction de handicap, vous pouvez faire correspondre le niveau des deux personnes. Parce que le temps de match-up est court, je peux jouer n'importe quand et n'importe où quand j'en ressens. Bien sûr, il existe également un mode de lecture 1P pour son temps.

		"description": "It is a game series where two people can play against one device. If you play with your body in close contact, the match will be more fun. Any two partners, including parents, friends, lover, etc, are suitable. Because it is simple and rules that everyone knows, you can start the game immediately on the spot. If you use the handicap function you can match the level of the two people. Because the match-up time is short, I can play anytime and anywhere when I feel like it. Of course there is also a 1P play mode for one's time. Please enjoy together! \"SPEED\" is one of simple and profound card games that will win if you use up your hand first. It is characterized by requiring reflexes.",
