Now you can discover - or rediscover - the original game that made Mario a household name. Run and jump with Mario or Luigi through caves and castles, down pipes and across platforms, and face off against Bowser to rescue your beloved Princess Peach. It may be more than a quarter of a century old, but Super Mario Bros. is still as enchanting as ever!
