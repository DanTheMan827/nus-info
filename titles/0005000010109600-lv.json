	"description": "In 1994, at the dawn of 32-bit consoles, one game blew away the competition with its pre-rendered 3D graphics, cartoon-quality animation and atmospheric music – on the 16-bit Super NES™! Donkey Kong Country breathed new life into the character of Donkey Kong™, and introduced gamers to Diddy Kong™, Cranky Kong™ and bad guys the Kremlings. Join DK and Diddy on a quest to recover their stolen banana hoard. Traverse more than 30 challenging levels, take a ride on animal buddies and survive the madcap mine cart sequences. You'd be bananas not to play Donkey Kong Country! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
