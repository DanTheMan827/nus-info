	"description": "Kirby Super Star features not one, not two, but six games in one – plus extra modes and minigames – all starring the powerful pink hero with the ability to copy his enemies’ abilities. Each adventure has its own storyline, featuring Kirby battling against classic foes like Meta Knight and King Dedede, and unique gameplay; from platforming to treasure-hunting and even a space shoot ‘em up! A friend can also join in as Kirby’s helper, using their own copy abilities to attack enemies and come to Kirby’s aid. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
