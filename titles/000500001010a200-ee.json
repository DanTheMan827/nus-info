	"description": "Donkey Kong has been kidnapped by the evil Kaptain K. Rool, who demands DK’s banana hoard as a ransom. But there’s no way the Kongs are going to give it up that easily! In this pirate-themed sequel to the hit Donkey Kong Country™, guide Diddy and Dixie Kong through eight wild worlds of comical action across the Kremling-infested Crocodile Isle. Discover secrets, learn new abilities, meet new Kong family members and take the reins of new animal buddies such as Squitter the Spider and Rattly the Rattlesnake. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the European version of the game, which was optimised originally by the developer to offer gameplay and music speed similar to the US version. Demos and animations may run at PAL speed. The aspect ratio has been corrected for this release.",
