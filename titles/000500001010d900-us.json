	"description": "EA SPORTS delivers award-winning gameplay-including the Player Impact Engine-HD graphics, and over 500 officially licensed clubs. Three revolutionary new ways to play bring players of all abilities together. Families can play together in Co-op Mode, where one player manages and up to four others play. Team Management Control features interactive radar to send players on supporting runs and touch screen control to change tactics, formations or subs on the fly. Experience the thrill of managing your favorite club in Manage Match, directing players from the sidelines and even giving half-time talks. Innovations that utilize the Wii Uâ„¢ GamePad put you on the pitch and in the action. Lift and look through the GamePad touch screen to aim the ball on set pieces and penalty kicks, then put the perfect curve on your shot and let it fly. Plus, connect and interact with friends. See your friends online and invite them to play, or message them in real-time using touch screen typing.",
