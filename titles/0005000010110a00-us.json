	"description": "A free game update on February 26, 2013 includes one new costume each for Ryu Hayabusa, Ayane, Momiji and Kasumi, as well as 25 new Ninja Trials missions. The update is free to everyone that owns the game, and will be downloaded to the system automatically. NINJA GAIDEN™ 3 has been completely revamped to bring to the Wii U™ console the truly intense, high-speed challenge and action NINJA GAIDEN fans demand. With more weapon and Ninpo types, a new character progression system and a redesigned battle system, the NINJA GAIDEN 3: Razor’s Edge game improves upon the original NINJA GAIDEN 3 in every way and offers Wii U exclusive features and functionality. As a solitary Ninja, Ryu Hayabusa, the player must find the way to lift the deathly curse on his right arm before the curse destroys himself. As one of the Wii U exclusive features, the female ninja, Ayane, will join the battle as a new playable character in her own new exclusive chapters in the story mode. The game also offers up to 8-player competitive and 2-player co-op multiplayer online modes*. *Broadband Internet access required for online features.",
