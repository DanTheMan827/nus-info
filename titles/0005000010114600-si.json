	"description": "Mega Man's original adventure blasts onto Nintendo eShop! The series became famous for its challenging mix of platforming and shoot 'em up action; and here you can see how it all began. As a super-robot created by the genius Dr. Light, it's up to Mega Man to traverse ten unique stages and beat the devious Robot Masters designed by evil Dr. Wily. Beating each boss allows Mega Man to use its trademark weapon, giving you an advantage in other stages - a technique still used in the series today. This is the US version of the game.",
