	"description": "A curse has struck Horo-Horo village and their beloved princess has vanished. All hope rests on the village’s guardians, Kid Ying and Dr. Yang. This action-adventure from the popular Goemon series is a light-hearted tale for one or two players. You and a friend can explore towns for clues, play minigames and learn new moves; and then battle through platform sections to defeat each level’s boss. Full of humour and Japanese folklore, The Legend of the Mystical Ninja is a quirky classic! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the European version of the game, which was originally optimised by the developer to play music at a speed similar to the US version. Gameplay, demos and animations run at PAL speed. The aspect ratio has been corrected for this release.",
