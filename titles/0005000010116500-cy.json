Your goal is get to the core of the corruption and save the island! – Explore a beautiful, Metroidvania style open world. – Discover how to interact with the creatures in your environment. – Use the Wii U™ GamePad as a camera and snap photos of creatures for the Tokidex. – Play on the GamePad, or use the second screen for extra info. – Follow the path, or stray off-road and tackle the expert puzzles. – Toki Tori 2+ is huge. We dare you to find all it has to offer!",
