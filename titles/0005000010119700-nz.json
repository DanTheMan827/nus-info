	"description": "You are the last hope of the people of Gradius. Your hyperspace fighter is armed with the greatest arsenal in the galaxy: air-to-surface and double beam laser cannons, powerful force fields and more. You’ll need them all to survive, because at the heart of the Bacterion Empire awaits the nerve centre of the evil Bacterion Bio-Computer. Gradius began the legendary space shooting series from Konami®. A true classic and an important part of video game history. Remember: shoot the core! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
