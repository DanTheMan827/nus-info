	"description": "Lode Runner is a landmark action-puzzle game that has spawned many sequels and created countless inspiration. Simple action blends with deviously designed stages, as you collect gold while avoiding enemy robots by digging holes in the floor. Use your brain and your reflexes to complete each puzzling stage and escape to the next. In addition to normal play, the game also features an edit mode that allows you to design your own stages, adding a new level of enjoyment. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
