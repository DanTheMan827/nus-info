	"description": "\"A beautiful masterpiece\", \"inventive, moving and unrelentingly funny\", \"a deft statement on games and how we play them\" - Little Inferno is an unusual game filled with surprise and wonder, and even better the less you know about it before playing. Congratulations on your new Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace! Throw your toys into your fire, and play with them as they burn. Stay warm in there. It's been snowing for as long as anyone can remember! Burn flaming logs, screaming robots, credit cards, batteries, exploding fish, unstable nuclear devices and tiny galaxies. An adventure that takes place almost entirely in front of a fireplace - about looking up up up out of the chimney, and the cold world just on the other side of the wall. - From the designers of World of Goo and Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure. - 100% indie - made by three guys with no office, no publishers and no funding. - IAP free - no spam, upselling or ads of any sort. Just the game.",
