	"description": "Has Mega Man’s nemesis Dr Wily finally changed his ways? Only time will tell, as Mega Man must deal with a new threat: eight fiendish robot masters lurking in eight new challenging stages of platform-shooter perfection! This NES™ classic expanded upon the hit formula with two game-changing additions. Mega Man can now slide as well as run; giving him unprecedented manoeuvrability. He also has a new sidekick, Rush the robot dog, who brings new abilities, like a jet or submarine, aiding Mega Man in his mission. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
