	"description": "In this NES™ classic, Wrecking Crew, Mario and Luigi swap their plumber’s caps for hard hats as they take on the role of demolition engineers! One or two players must demolish every obstacle in each enemy-infested level, while working out the most destructive route through the networks of ladders and scaffolds. Wrecking Crew includes a mode for designing your own levels. This Virtual Console™ version also features the ability to save your creations, which was not possible in the NES original. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
