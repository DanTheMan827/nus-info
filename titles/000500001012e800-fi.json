	"description": "A year after the events of Mega Man™ 3, the world is still at peace. However, mysterious scientist Dr. Cossack announces his plan to eliminate Mega Man, and prove himself to be the greatest robot designer of all time. It's up to Mega Man to save the day once again! Mega Man 4 provides even more fiendish platform-action gameplay and eight new robot masters to defeat. Mega Man now also has his Mega Buster to charge up energy, allowing him to fire larger and more damaging blasts. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
