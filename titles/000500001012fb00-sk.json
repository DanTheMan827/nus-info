	"description": "The epic series, The Legend of Zelda™ began here, with the heroic Link on a hazardous journey through the fantastic world of Hyrule. Using your sword, your shield and your wits, retrieve the eight fragments of the Triforce and save Princess Zelda. This ground-breaking game introduced innovative ideas that are still present in Zelda games more than 25 years later. Not only is Link's original adventure action-packed, it also features puzzling dungeons to explore and a myriad of secrets to discover. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
