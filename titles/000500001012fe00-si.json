	"description": "In the distant kingdom of Angel Land the cruel goddess Medusa has stolen the three sacred treasures and has imprisoned the Goddess of Light, Palutena. Only you, Kid Icarus, will be able to recover the treasures, destroy Medusa and rescue Palutena from captivity. During your adventure you will traverse eerie ruins, in which you'll find weapons and valuable remedies. These will be essential if you want to win the fight against Medusa's army. A bow and arrow will come in handy when the sinister underworld gatekeepers are blocking your way. Once you've defeated all of Medusa's underlings, you'll be faced with the greatest challenge: Medusa herself! Will you succeed in rescuing Palutena and returning the sacred treasures? If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
