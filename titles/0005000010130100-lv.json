	"description": "This direct sequel to the original The Legend of Zelda™ is famed for taking the series in a new direction, while also introducing elements that would become standard in future Zelda games. In Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Link must seek the Triforce of Courage and awaken Princess Zelda from a sleeping spell. Meanwhile, Ganon’s minions are trying to resurrect their master. Zelda II uses a side-scrolling view and overworld map, and features role-playing aspects that are unique to the series. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
