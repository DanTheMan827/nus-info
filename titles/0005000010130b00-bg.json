	"description": "A century of Transylvanian tranquillity has ended. Count Dracula has returned, and this time he has a tombstone with your name on it, Simon Belmont! Super Castlevania IV is a highlight of Konami’s popular Castlevania series, bringing some of the finest platform exploration and action to Super NES™. Explore the castle and its gruesome grounds, using your whip like a grappling hook to swing past traps; and arm yourself with weapons like axes, holy water and more, to send Dracula’s minions back to the grave! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
