	"description": "A mysterious tropical paradise known as Adventure Island is the setting for this side-scrolling action game. The evil Witch Doctor has kidnapped Tina, the true love of Master Higgins. To save her, you must safely guide Master Higgins through eight perilous stages—including dense forests and creepy caves—while defeating all of the enemies in your path. Each area is made up of four rounds filled with enemies determined to stop you in your tracks. In addition, as time passes, Master Higgins’s vitality is automatically drained. To keep going, he must eat constantly by grabbing fruit, milk, and whatever other goodies he can as he races toward his goal. Sometimes eggs will appear that contain miraculous items, like axes to throw at enemies or honey that grants temporary invincibility. Use items skillfully to help you clear the areas. At the end of each area, you'll face the Witch Doctor, whom you must defeat to advance. Go, Master Higgins, go!",
