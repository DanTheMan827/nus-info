	"description": "Renowned as one of the most challenging platform games of all time, Ghosts'n Goblins pits brave knight Arthur on a hair-raising journey to rescue his beloved princess from her supernatural captors. Arm yourself with your trusty lance, and find jars to upgrade to weapons like the dagger, torch or axe, then battle your way through six monster-infested stages until the final confrontation with the Devil himself! But beware the Devil's tricks! The princess may be further away than you think... If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
