After a few flight lessons with Skipper, throttle forward over the world of Cars, just like Disney’s hit movie Planes. Fly solo or fly with a wingman to complete flight objectives or challenge each other to an Air Rally race or a Balloon Pop challenge. And if you want to stretch your wings, get airborne with a leisurely Free Flight. Just don’t look down! Fly with a friend to complete Story Mode missions and explore levels together in Free Flight. Or challenge a friend to an Air Rallies race or a Balloon Pop challenge. This game is also available in Danish, Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish.",
