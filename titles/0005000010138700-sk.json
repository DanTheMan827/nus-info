Turn off your TV, get your friends and family together, sit in a circle around the GamePad and play Spin the Bottle: Bumpie’s Party. Look at each other, do silly challenges, have fun and get a little closer. Spin the Bottle: Bumpie's Party is a game for 2-8 players. You sit in a circle around the GamePad and spin a virtual bottle.

Collaborate with your friends and complete the most challenges to win Bumpie's Party! Spin the Bottle might be tongue-in-cheek, but don’t worry kissing is not required. - 17 different collaborative physical mini games. - Look at, touch and communicate with each other. - Play anywhere; you are not limited by your TV. All updates and additional content for the game will be free. Each release of new content will raise the price a bit, so buy now and save money.",
