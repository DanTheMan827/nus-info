	"description": "TENNIS was the first game to bring the sport to the NES™, and includes singles or doubles matches against five different levels of enemies. While the controls are simple, it takes time to master the techniques and defeat the toughest opponents. Practise your volleys and smashes if you want to succeed! Also you may recognise a familiar moustachioed mascot making a guest appearance in the umpire's chair... If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
