	"description": "The NES™ version of PINBALL was one of the first video game recreations of the classic game, and is still as crowd-pleasing as ever. Use the flippers to keep the ball in play for as long as possible, and rack up a winning score. There are two difficulty settings, and modes for one or two players so you and a friend can battle for the highest score. Mario™ also makes an appearance in the bonus stage in which you must save Pauline, the damsel in distress from Donkey Kong™, with your pinball prowess! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
