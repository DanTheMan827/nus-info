	"description": "Prepare to face-off for one of the most faithful sports simulations on the NES™. Ice Hockey offers straightforward fun to just jump in and play, either solo or against a friend, yet also requires tactical skills for players who want to fine-tune their team. You can customise each squad member, selecting from three different body types, affecting their offence and defence. Leaner players are faster and better in a face-off, while heavier players have stronger body checks and shooting skills. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
