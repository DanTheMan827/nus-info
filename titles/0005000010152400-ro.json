	"description": "Toki Tori is the first of three Two Tribes classics to arrive on Wii U™ eShop. Next up will be 3D puzzler RUSH and retro platformer EDGE. While the classic gameplay has remained intact, Toki Tori has been adapted to make use of the Wii U™ GamePad, allowing for off-TV play and optional touch controls. The gameplay in Toki Tori is a blend of two genres. While it looks like a platform game, it's a puzzle game at heart. To progress through the game, the player must pick up each egg in a level using a set number of tools. Players will have to look and plan ahead carefully while using items such as the Telewarp, Freeze-o-Matic and InstantRock™. Additional tools are gradually introduced as the player progresses through the game's 80+ levels covering five unique worlds. • Off-TV gameplay supported • Both touch screen and traditional controls • A wide variety of items and weapons • Over 80 levels spread over 5 worlds • For all ages - accessible and hard levels available",
