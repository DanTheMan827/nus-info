	"description": "Originally released in 2010, the unforgettable first chapter of the Bayonetta saga introduced the world to \"climax action\", an explosive blend of dynamic action and saucy style. Armed with a gun in each hand and one on each foot, Bayonetta destroys her opponents with combo attacks that are as beautiful as they are brutal. Dodge enemy attacks with perfect timing to activate Witch Time, leaving your slowed-down opponents defenceless against your barrage of kicks, blows and bullets, then finish them off with a devastating Torture Attack. No angel will stand in Bayonetta’s way. Enhancements to the original game include the addition of several Nintendo-themed costumes for Bayonetta – whether donning a memorable green tunic or rolling around dropping bombs like a famous bounty hunter, the Umbra Witch has never looked better. And with touch controls on the Wii U GamePad and off-TV play for the whole adventure, you can get closer to Bayonetta than ever before. This game also supports Japanese.",
