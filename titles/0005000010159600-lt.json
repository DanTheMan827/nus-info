	"description": "The classic Super NES™ \"cute ‘em up\" returns, thanks to Virtual Console™! Pilot the sweet yet powerful spacecraft TwinBee and WinBee, as you fend off the forces of the Donguri army. Fly through seven stages solo or simultaneously with a friend, to defeat the evil Dr Mardock’s forces. Power up by collecting bells; shooting them to change their colour and effect. Two players can also team up, to transfer energy if one of you is low, or to grab and throw a player around the screen and take out multiple enemies! This is the European version of the game, which was originally optimised by the developer to play music at a speed similar to the Japanese version. Gameplay, demos and animations run at PAL speed. The aspect ratio has been corrected for this release.",
