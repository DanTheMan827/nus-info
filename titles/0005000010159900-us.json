Then purchase and sync a Fit Meter to Wii Fit U to keep the game for as long as you like. A Fit Meter has many features of modern activity meters, and it sells for an MSRP of only $19.99 (actual price may vary). With Wii Fit™ U, you can workout at home or on the go with the Fit Meter (sold separately), a device that tracks your calories burned, steps taken, elevation changes, etc. Then sync the Fit Meter data to your in-game profile with one button press. The Wii Fit™ U software lets you create routines, review progress, and compare with friends in online Gym Communities and Miiverse. Shape up with over 70 fun activities, from new ones using the Wii U GamePad controller to Wii Fit favorites. Even use the GamePad to get active with Off-TV play.",
