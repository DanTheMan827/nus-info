	"description": "The Mirror World, which exists in the skies of Dream Land, has been invaded by an evil shadow and Kirby's the only one who can save the day! Fortunately, he won't have to go at it alone. He's been split into four Kirbys of different colors, and he can call up his colorful clones to lend a hand when needed. Summon Red, Yellow, and Green Kirby to help you solve puzzles, fight enemies, or take out the big baddies. Use copy abilities such as the arrow-shooting Cupid Kirby or the melee master Smash Kirby, while platforming through the maze-like world. Need a break from the action? Try a hand at minigames such as Crackity Hack and Kirby's Wave Ride, which also star our favorite pink hero and friends!",
