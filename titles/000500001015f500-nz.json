	"description": "Fight back against Dracula in the third exciting instalment of the highly popular Castlevania franchise! As with the original ‘Castlevania’, the player’s goal is to work their way through deviously challenging levels, but this time there's a difference - when the level ends, you can choose one of two paths to take for a completely different experience! The most innovative feature of this game lies with the spirit companions that the player will meet through the journey. Besides the main character Trevor, who uses the traditional Belmont weapon, the Mystic Whip, as well as a number of items, the player can also strike up a spiritual partnership with any one of three distinctive characters. These include Sypha the imprisoned sorceress, Grant the pirate, who is able to jump high and climb up walls, and Alucard, who is Dracula's son but has a bone to pick with his father. With a range of diverse characters and paths available to choose from, this game boasts incredible replay value, ensuring that each playthrough is a new experience! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
