	"description": "Experience the first ever football game for the NES™! Soccer offers a choice between seven national teams (Brazil, Germany, Spain, France, England, Japan and the USA) and five different difficulty levels. Play solo against the computer or compete against a friend in the two-player mode. Soccer was also one of the first football games to include penalty shootouts at the end of regulation time, and also features an entertaining half-time show! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
