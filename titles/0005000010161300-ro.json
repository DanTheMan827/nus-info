	"description": "Kung-Fu Heroes is a comical action game starring Jacky and Lee; two martial arts masters who must save a princess and retrieve treasure when monsters attack their land. Battle your way through eight castles, each with four stages, packed with traps, enemies and obstacles. Search the stones and rocks within the levels to reveal bonus stages and maybe even shortcuts to other castles. Only your quick wits and reflexes will see you through to the final castle, and to secure the princess's safety. This is the US version of the game.",
