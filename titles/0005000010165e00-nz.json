	"description": "It’s been two years since Arnold and Sonya were made into Shockmen. A message from the Professor to 'return to their bodies' has them head to his laboratory, but they are ambushed by a mysterious enemy along the way. Our heroes foil the ambush, but then they catch a TV newsflash announcing the 'RYO EMPIRE' invasion. They discover that the Professor has been kidnapped, and set out to rescue him. Shockman is a side-view action shooter that has 8 stages including Action Stages, where you jump and use special techniques, and side-scrolling Shooting Stages. This game expands on the well-paced story from the previous version, and contains co-operative elements such as 'shared life' and a powerful 'Team Shockbeam' that can be used during two-player simultaneous play. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price.",
