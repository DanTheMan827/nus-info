	"description": "In the 23rd century, invaders from the future suddenly attack Earth. Controlling a fighter created by the world’s scientists, you rise to meet the enemy. Collect power-up units, such as LASER, E-BEAM, FIRE, and MISSILE, and then equip them in Options to launch a variety of attacks. For each of these weapons, you can freely select from three different types in SET-UP. Anticipate enemies’ strikes and deftly switch between weapons to defeat the invaders! In addition to NORMAL GAME, there are also 2 MINUTE GAME and 5 MINUTE GAME score-attack modes. The most perfect blend and balance of any game in the series, Final Soldier is a title you don’t want to miss.",
