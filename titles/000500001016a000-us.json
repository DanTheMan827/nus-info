	"description": "Bask in the greedy glory of treasure-hoarding as you hop, roll, and zombify Wario™ through 20 huge, puzzle-packed levels. This critically praised platformer sees our stubby anti-hero in search of gold, jewels, and riches beyond imagining, but when his insatiable need for loot lands him in a twisted pyramid of traps, he’ll need your wits to get out! There's lots of treasure in there for the taking, and Wario wants it all. There are plenty of punches, jumps, kicks, and tricks to master throughout the gameplay and various forms for Wario to take, like Flaming Wario, Vampire Bat Wario, or Zombie Wario that can be used to uncover some of the pyramid’s hidden hoard. Lots of bad guys and boss characters will try to make your escape more difficult, and there are plenty of unique challenges to stretch your reflexes and imagination. True to Wario style, there are even a handful of mini-games to keep you amused when you're not adventuring.",
