	"description": "Proto Man - once the trusted brother of Mega Man - has mysteriously gone berserk, kidnapping Dr. Light and forcing Mega Man to go on the offensive. Assisted by his new sidekick Beat, a robotic bird, and his faithful robo-dog Rush, Mega Man must battle through eight thrilling levels and defeat the robot masters lurking within. Defy gravity in Gravity Man's stage, chip away the defences in Stone Man's stage and catch some surf in Wave Man's stage, before the final showdown! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
