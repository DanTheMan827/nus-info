	"description": "The Amazing Spider-Man 2 takes place outside the events of the second film in a unique story where Spider-Man discovers a larger threat to NYC that has turned the underworld upside down. Villains from the film as well as fan-favorite, classic Marvel characters are woven together in a twisted web of adrenaline-fueled, free-roaming, web-slinging action that puts players on a collision course with an evil far beyond Spider-Man’s reckoning.",
