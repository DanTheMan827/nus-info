	"description": "In this acclaimed retelling of the original Metroid adventure, step into the boots of bounty hunter Samus Aran as she infiltrates planet Zebes for the first time, to take down the Space Pirates and Mother Brain... but this is not the Zebes that you might remember! Metroid: Zero Mission features completely redesigned environments, based on the original maze-like levels, but enhanced with new features like Morph Ball launchers and zip lines; and it’s crawling with vicious new enemies and bosses. Plus – once you’ve defeated Mother Brain, the mission is far from over!",
