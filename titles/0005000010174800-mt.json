	"description": "Get on down with Dig Dug, and wage underground war with your trusty pump! Vanquish persistent Pookas and fiery Fygars to clear each stage. Defeat enemiesb by inflating them with air or by dropping rocks on them from above. Earn bonus points by collecting fruit or defeating deep-dwelling foes. This classic game blends old-school arcade action with strategy; try to lure multiple enemies into position and satisfyingly squash them with a single rock! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the Japanese version of the game. All in-game text is in English.",
