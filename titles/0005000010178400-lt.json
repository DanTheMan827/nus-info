	"description": "It's the wildest west you've ever seen in this action-packed third-person shooter! The Kid gang and their army of robots have taken over the town. The only ones who can stop them are Clint and Annie, two tough gunslingers with a serious score to settle. You'll need a sharp eye and quick-draw reflexes, plus moves like the dive-roll and double jump. Plus, you can rope enemies with a lasso and clear the screen with explosive special attacks. It's your job to bring justice back to town – or whatever's left of it when the smoke clears! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
