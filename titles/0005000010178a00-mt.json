	"description": "Long ago, the war between the dragon clans almost destroyed the world. Now, centuries after the Light and Dark Dragons settled their scores, evil is rising again! Join Ryu, a descendant of the Light Dragons, who has the ability to transform into a powerful beast, in a quest to rescue his sister and stop the Dark Dragons’ plans. He is joined by a band of seven companions, each with unique animal powers. Developed by Capcom, Breath of Fire also features cleverly-hidden character cameos – if you know where to look! This is the US version of the game.",
