	"description": "The kingdom of Renais lies in ruins, shattered by a sudden invasion from a former ally. Use cunning strategy to guide the royal heirs, Eirika and Ephraim, on their twin quest to rebuild Renais. Take advantage of your strengths and exploit your enemy’s weaknesses, but be careful. If a soldier perishes on the battlefield, they are gone forever! In a world of dragons and magic, you must always be ready for battle. Take advantage of the terrain and the weapon in your hand, and attack enemies either from afar using magic or up close with your sword. Each weapon has its own strength and weakness, so choose wisely when attacking your opponent, because you don’t want to be caught off guard. Build the perfect army. Do you want a pegasus rider or a wyvern rider? An assassin or a rouge? Upgrade your troops to different classes, each with their own skills and weapon choices.",
