The high-living Hillers have challenged the blue-collar Southsiders to a no-holds-barred series of street sports, and you must lead your team to victory! In Crash 'n the Boys Street Challenge, compete for medals in various events including 400 Metre Hurdles, Hammer Throw and Swimming; but with a street-based twist like racing across rooftops and hand-to-hand combat. This is the US version of the game.",
