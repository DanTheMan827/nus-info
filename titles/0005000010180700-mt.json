	"description": "The sometimes cowardly, sometimes courageous Captain Toad embarks on his first solo adventure for Wii U! This puzzle-platformer game sees the diminutive hero from SUPER MARIO 3D WORLD adventure through a wide range of levels. Captain Toad is joined on his adventure by Toadette. Unlike traditional video game heroes, Captain Toad and Toadette don’t have any special powers – these tiny heroes can’t even jump! Plus, they’re terrified of just about everything, but they face their adventures head on. Armed with headlights and a can-do attitude, they must make their way through enemy-infested locales like Wild West shanties and Goomba waterparks. Each location is bursting with puzzles to solve and secrets to unearth. The tiny heroes are on the hunt for the ultimate treasure, a coveted Power Star. At the beginning of their adventure, Wingo, a giant, greedy bird who makes life difficult for these timid treasure trackers, makes off with their only Power Star, and even whisks away Toadette! Help Captain Toad retrieve the Power Star, reunite with Toadette and, ultimately, defeat Wingo. In the process, they’ll encounter more than 70 fun, puzzling stages while also collecting stars and gems! Visit amiibo.nintendo.eu for compatible amiibo™ and the latest information.",
