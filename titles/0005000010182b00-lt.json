	"description": "The year is 2201 and the ultra high-speed F-ZERO is the most popular sport in the universe. Take control of eight different characters; from veteran Captain Falcon to newcomer Rick Wheeler: a cop injured in the past who is re-awoken to help bring down the criminal gangs exploiting F-ZERO for their own gain. In Story Mode, speed through a series of narrative-led races across the galaxy while competing in four Grand Prix cups. You can also set your best laps in Time Attack, and master special challenges in Zero Test mode.",
