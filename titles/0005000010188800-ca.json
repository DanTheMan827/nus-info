	"description": "Lan and Mega Man are ready to prove they're the strongest in the next tournament! But there seems to be a more sinister plan behind the event... Game content is the same for MEGA MAN BN 3 BLUE and MEGA MAN BN 3 WHITE, but NetNavi chips and other items may differ. Lan and Mega Man are hanging out with their friends when they are approached by a mysterious man wearing a cowboy hat. He invites all of them to participate in the N1 Grand Prix, where the grand prize is the title for best NetBattler! It sounds like fun, and they're all up for the challenge! Strategize your attacks by collecting Battle Chips, or escape when the best course of action is to run! Use the Navi Customizer to style Mega Man's functions to suit your needs. Sometimes, malfunctions can also work to your advantage! Select Comm. on the PET screen to add special NetNavi chips to your inventory.",
