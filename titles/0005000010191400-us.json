	"description": "Big Al and the Street Kings think they can take over the streets for themselves. Punch, kick, and slam your way through 6 stages of rough-and-tough action, solo or with a friend! Or go against a friend and see who really owns the turf. Jack Flak and Oozie Nelson bring their brawling skills to the street against Big Al and his gang of miscreants, otherwise known as the Street Kings. Test out a myriad of street-fighting techniques against waves of enemies as a lone hero, or bring a sidekick! Take enough punches and your inner Angry Mode will rear its ugly head against your foes. You can also battle against a friend in Vs mode and see who's left standing.",
