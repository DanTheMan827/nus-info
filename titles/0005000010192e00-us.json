	"description": "Dr. Weil and Omega are plotting to use the Dark Elf's power to seize command of Neo Arcadia. Zero must use everything at his disposal to stop their plan before all hope and life is lost! Two months after stopping a possessed Elpizo, Zero and the Resistance are sent out to investigate a mysterious ship that is emitting a familiar energy source. As Zero takes a closer look, he discovers that Dr. Weil and Omega—both banished from Neo Arcadia long ago—have returned and are seeking the power of the Dark Elf. With it, they will destroy all humankind and take over Neo Arcadia for themselves. Use Zero's jump, dash, and wall kick to get to your next challenge. When a simple attack doesn't suffice, equip EX Skills, Cyber-elves, and other special items to boost your abilities. Travel to Cyberspace, and discover the mirror image of the current world. Stay steadfast on your course to return peace to a world that is on the brink of destruction!",
