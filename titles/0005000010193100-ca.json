	"description": "Trouble is brewing in Metro City. After a massive takedown on crime and violence by Mayor Mike Haggar, the Mad Gear Gang take revenge by kidnapping the mayor's daughter, Jessica. Knowing that he won't be able to battle this storm on his own, he enlists the help of two acquaintancesâ€”Cody and Guy. Take on the role of either Cody, Guy, or Mike as they punch, kick, and throw down throngs of thugs. Defeat all enemies in order to advance to the next stage. In this version of the game, there are six stages showing a different area of the city, including an extra stage that was not available in the SNES version of Final Fight. Scour the city streets and rescue Jessica before it's too late!",
