	"description": "Three friends are transported to a strange world unlike our own. Surrounded by strange creatures and even stranger locals, Cora and her friends have only their wits and a brace of water guns to rely upon! Luckily for our plucky trio of outlanders, the water found in this curious new land possesses mysterious qualities; transforming their ordinary water guns into powerful weapons. Set off on an epic adventure with up to 4 friends. Explore the breath-taking sky islands of Evan and aid their inhabitants by completing challenging quests and defeating the hordes of monsters that plague the land. Discover the secrets of Evan’s towers and defeat the dangerous creatures that guard them.
