	"description": "Mario may be two-dimensional but this adventure is anything but thin! Paper Mario brilliantly blends the heroic plumber's platform antics with a hilarious role-playing quest full of offbeat characters and wacky challenges. Embark on an epic journey through the Mushroom Kingdom to release the Star Spirits imprisoned by a power-hungry Bowser. Along the way you’ll fight enemies in entertaining turn-based battles, team up with a variety of uniquely skilled partners, discover secret minigames, and even bake a cake! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the European version of the game, which was originally optimised by the developer to play music at a speed similar to the US version. Gameplay, demos and animations run at PAL speed. The aspect ratio has been corrected for this release.",
