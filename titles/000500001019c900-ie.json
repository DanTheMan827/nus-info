	"description": "A Battle of Epic Proportions! Alphadia Genesis boasts a rich, complex story starring Fray, a member of the local guild, and Corone, a knight. As their journey progresses and conflicting national interests come to the forefront, it becomes apparent that it may take more than a little work on both their parts if their relationship is to weather the foreboding storm on the horizon. 3D battles feature beautifully rendered graphics, dynamic camera angles, and more skills than you can shake a sword at! Learning to harness these skills will allow you to become more adept in battle, which will come in handy, as some of these baddies will seem nigh unbeatable at first!",
