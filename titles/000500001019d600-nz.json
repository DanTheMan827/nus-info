	"description": "Kirby, Meta Knight, King Dedede and Waddle Dee are ready to transform your living room into Dream Land once more in Kirby's Adventure Wii! In this side-scrolling adventure game, you can play on your own or with up to three of your friends. Kirby, in his many guises, is in control of the infamous foursome – help him use his powerful Copy Ability to inhale, spit or transform as enemies rise to the challenge. Kicking off this action packed adventure, an alien spaceship has crash-landed, scattering pieces of the ship across the otherwise peaceful Popstar land. The alien is desperate to return to its home planet and so Kirby and his enemies decide to work together and help - starting out on a mission to find the missing chunks of the vessel which have been spread across the realm. Play on your own or recruit up to three friends who can join in the fun. Whether you want to all play as Kirby, each in a different colour, or mix things up by each taking a different character – Meta Knight, King Dedede and Waddle Dee – you can all enjoy playing cooperatively to progress through the game by collecting Point Stars and Ability Stars. Don’t worry if you only meet up with your friends for a short while, anyone can join and leave the game at any time. ",
