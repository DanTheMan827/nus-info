This definitive edition of the beloved adventure game for Nintendo GameCube and Wii features revitalised visuals that will further immerse players in its stunning landscapes and epic story. You play as Link, a farm hand who is chosen by the gods to free the kingdom of Hyrule from the clutches of the King of Shadows, Zant, who has cursed the land with a perpetual twilight. To help him take on this new menace and break the curse that has transformed him into a wolf, Link will team up with the mysterious and mischievous Midna, a creature from a corrupted dimension called the Twilight Realm. Use the Wii U GamePad touch screen to equip items and view maps without pausing the game, aim your Hero’s Bow and more using intuitive motion controls, or enjoy all the action on just one screen with Off-TV Play.
