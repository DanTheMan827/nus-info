	"description": "Little Ninja Brothers is the second in a series from Kung-Fu Heroes developer Culture Brain. Join Jack and Ryu on an adventure with action and role-playing elements, as you defeat the Yoma Clan and bring peace to Chinaland. Journey across the land - exploring cities and building up your items and weapons by visiting shops - and battle any enemies you encounter with hand-to-hand combat. Invite a friend along to share the skirmishes in two-player mode, and take a break from adventuring with various sporting events. This is the US version of the game.",
