	"description": "Affordable Space Adventures is a stealth puzzle spaceship simulator. Control your craft solo or in a crew of up to three players. The Wii U™ GamePad, acting as your Heads Down Display, gives you precise control over all the internal systems of the ship. You can tweak the thrusters, antigravity, stabilizer, decelerator and many more spaceship systems in order to successfully navigate a hostile planet and sneak past alien robots. You still deserve a robust and fail-safe spaceship while exploring space on a budget; watch the heat gauges, engine stress and output meters in order to safely control your vessel. Explosions, engine shutdowns, blown fuses and implosions may still occur. In co-op mode, players must coordinate as a crew controlling the spaceship together; one will take the role of engineer, while another will be the pilot. A science officer can join the fun as well, taking control of the scanner, shooting flares and moving the flashlight on the ship. • Experience the thrilling, spooky and beautiful world crafted and designed in collaboration with Swedish indie game developer “Nifflas”. • Two difficulty levels: Technical and Tourist. • Play with your friends and control the ship together, or take on the challenge alone. • A game that truly utilizes the potential of the Wii U™ hardware.",
