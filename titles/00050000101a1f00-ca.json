	"description": "Wario and his friends have prepared over 180 microgames that will test your skills using the Wii U™ GamePad's Touch Screen and built-in microphone. There's also plenty to do after meeting the whole cast. You can replay any microgame, top your best score, or sort through souvenirs and characters in the Games area. One day, Wario came upon a system that had two screens. He saw money—literally! New microgames through WarioWare, Inc. would bring a whole new flow of profit. Together with his friends, Wario fabricated loads of microgames to test reaction and speed. Tap a button, rub on the genie lamp, slice the ham bone, or blow away the leaves. These are just some of the actions that await you. Once you've completed a microgame, you can play it again to try to beat your best score. You'll also earn some fun and weird souvenirs that you can sort out later.",
