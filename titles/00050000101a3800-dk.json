	"description": "Don't let the comic look fool you. Being a good RGB agent requires a lot of talent. Spy Chameleon is an arcade-puzzle game where the player must avoid being seen thanks to the chameleon's ability to change colors and camouflage. Through 5 missions and 75 levels, the player will discover different enemies and abilities to complete these super-secret missions: taking photos of a celebrity with her lover and stealing the secret formula of a successful soft drink are just two examples. Watch your enemies, choose the best path and run to the next safe point. The duration of each level can mean finishing a game in just minutes or spending hours trying to complete the missions and all the challenges, getting the best time among your friends or completing all the achievements. Game features: - change colors to camouflage yourself with your surroundings - 75 levels where the difficulty increases as you learn new mechanics - 3 challenges in each level: gather collectables and beat a time - playability that combines reflexes, synchronization and strategy (at 60 FPS in 1080p) - compare your best times with those of your friends or the whole world",
