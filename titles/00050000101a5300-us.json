Using a simple control scheme that makes the game fun and easy to play, players of all skill levels can swing and climb to new heights. Donkey Kong and his friends decide to take a well-earned vacation at the beautiful Sun Sun Island.

Without hesitation, they race off for the mountaintop, wondering what kind of adventure they'll find! Play as Donkey Kong, or choose to play as Diddy Kong™ in Adventure mode. Players can look forward to new moves, new items, and a bunch of mini-games that are sure to make them go bananas!",
