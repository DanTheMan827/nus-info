	"description": "Nobody knows why your dad, champion car battler Jim Todoroki, suddenly abandoned the fastest and most popular sport in Galacia. There is a rumor going around that he's riding around with the most ruthless car-battler gangs in the world. But is it just a rumor, or is there truth behind it? Play as Joe Todoroki, in his quest to become a car battlerâ€”like his father before him. His mother says he has the talent, but hard work will be the payoff. Customize a vehicle in the Garage to enhance or diminish its performance. Sign up for jobs, missions, and even tournaments as Joe explores the dangerous highways and byways that surround his village. Other car battlers fight for money and fame, but Joe has a higher calling: to restore his family's honor and bring his father home!",
