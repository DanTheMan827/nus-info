	"description": "When Wario gets his mitts on a magic wand that can change his identity, will the thieving fiend become a master of disguise or a master of disaster? Jumping through his TV screen, Wario becomes the star of a globe-trotting show; taking him through 10 “episodes” from a luxury liner to an Egyptian pyramid in his quest for loot. Use the touch screen to transform Wario into various guises: draw a tail on him to become Dragon Wario with fiery breath, or sketch a space helmet to become Cosmic Wario armed with a laser blaster!",
