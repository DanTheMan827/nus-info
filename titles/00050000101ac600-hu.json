	"description": "Ride your Kawasaki jet ski to victory against fierce rivals and tumultuous waves. This is one of the defining racing games of the Nintendo 64™ as its impressive physics showed a new kind of experience that could only be possible with 3D game engines. Even today, its original take on racing, with buoys to pass from either their right or left side and a power-up system rewarding skilful racers, remains a fun and fresh challenge to enjoy by yourself or with a friend. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
