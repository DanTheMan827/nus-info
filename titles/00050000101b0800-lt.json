	"description": "Be careful not to miss a beat! Losing the rhythm in Beat the Beat: Rhythm Paradise means you lose the game - but don’t worry, the controls are really easy to pick up! Just press the A Button or the A Button and B Button together! Half the fun is learning how to master each situation, and while the action is just as challenging as fans of the series would expect, beginners won’t be stuck for long thanks to the new feature that allows you to check the correct performance of the song to help you to master the required rhythm. Some games can be played in co-op mode, so why not invite a friend to play with you? The aim is to play together and master the different rhythms; the more compatible you are, the higher your score! If you’re feeling particularly competitive then why not challenge your friend to play one of the Endless Dual Games? The fun doesn’t stop but the action becomes progressively harder as you go on - a real test of your rhythm skills.",
