Sin and Punishment™ tasks you as a young resistance fighter battling Ruffians – mutants bred for food who turned against their masters – and also facing corrupt military forces in your quest to save the planet. Originally released only in Japan for Nintendo 64™, Sin and Punishment is available once again via Virtual Console™, updated with English menu and tutorial text, and English subtitles in the ending sequence.
