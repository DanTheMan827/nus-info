	"description": "Take on the role of a trainee cop as you tackle the toughest shooting range around. Ready your reflexes and shoot the gangsters while avoiding the innocents. Originally an NES™ Zapper title, Hogan’s Alley returns with Wii Remote™ controls allowing you to aim quickly and accurately. Two different game modes allow you to test your skills against cardboard cutout targets, as they spin round or pop out from cover. A third mode lets you have fun and test your sharpshooting skills by keeping tin cans up in the air. This is the US version of the game.",
