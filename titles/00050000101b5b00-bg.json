	"description": "Mike Jones is an ordinary kid on an extraordinary adventure. When his archaeologist uncle goes missing on a tropical island, Mike sets off to uncover the dark secrets lurking in paradise. StarTropics boasts two styles of gameplay: explore the island on foot or in your uncle’s submarine, and battle monsters using a variety of weapons and items. The original NES release included a letter in the game box, with a hidden message. For the Virtual Console version, this has been reproduced in the electronic manual. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
