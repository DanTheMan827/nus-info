By drawing colourful rainbows, you can guide Kirby through the seven stages of this critically acclaimed game that inspired 2015's Kirby™ and the Rainbow Paintbrush on Wii U™. Draw lines and ramps to collect power-ups, draw loops to help him speed up, and double-tap on Kirby to help him fight enemies and collect their abilities. Collect medals to unlock secret features!",
