	"description": "The countdown has begun! You have just three days to save the land of Termina from destruction by its own moon, which is being pulled out of its orbit by a mysterious evil force! In this epic sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Link is bestowed with magical masks to aid him in his quest. Transform into a Deku Scrub, a Goron and a Zora, using their abilities to fly through the air, roll across the land or swim through the sea! Link has only 72 hours to save Termina, however he can re-live the days again and again using the magical Song of Time, to gather the knowledge and skills he needs to solve the mystery of Majora's Mask. A gripping storyline, charming characters, dozens of masks to discover – and the first appearance of Tingle! – complete this acclaimed package! If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price.",
