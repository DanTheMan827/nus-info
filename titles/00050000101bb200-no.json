	"description": "From the brilliant mind of Super Mario 64 creator Shigeru Miyamoto comes a gorgeous game with a guaranteed storybook ending. Follow the adventures of six Yoshis as they search through sunny woods, dark caves, soaring mountains, steaming jungles, vast oceans and gloomy castles for the Super Happy Tree, which has been stolen by the dreaded Baby Bowser. Loosely based on the Super NES classic Yoshi's Island, Yoshi's Story fully exploits the strengths of the N64. Yoshi can walk, run, swim, leap, flutter and fire his payload of eggs with unerring precision. The action takes place in storybook 'pages' made up of papery materials and other familiar textures – so you'll see wafer-thin forests, denim clouds and inflatable plastic islands. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
