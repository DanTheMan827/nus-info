	"description": "When Resident Evil 4 was released on the Nintendo GameCube in 2005, it wowed critics and players alike with its sensational reinvention of the survival horror genre. The superb graphics and tight controls made Resident Evil 4 one of the most praised games of all time. Leon S. Kennedy, formerly Raccoon City Police Department’s idealistic rookie cop, is now a U.S. agent with a top-secret mission to rescue the President’s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious organisation. Leon must begin his investigation with a trip to an undisclosed village in Europe, where he encounters a horde of unruly villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that perpetrated Ashley’s kidnapping. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who - or what - is behind everything.",
