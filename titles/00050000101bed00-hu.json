	"description": "Use an array of cameras to protect Grippy Toad and his precious metal mining site in Star Fox Guard, only on Wii U. Slippy Toad's uncle Grippy is busy with the job of gathering rare metals in space, but he's having trouble – he's being attacked by all kinds of enemies! Use Slippy's new invention to ward off waves of enemies and get them to leave Grippy alone! Use 12 cameras, setting them up in various locations to find and attack any enemies that approach the mining site. Use the television screen and Wii U GamePad in tandem to work out where the enemies are, then blast them away! You can also edit the placement of enemies and upload these enemy patterns online so others can play your stage. You can play in new ways by collecting rare metals when you upload stages, and also get rare metals by playing other players' stages. Visit amiibo.nintendo.eu for compatible amiibo™ and the latest information.",
