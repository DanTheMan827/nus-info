	"description": "Shutshimi is a randomized shoot 'em up about a muscle-bound fish with memory problems. Armed with your trusty bullet-morphing shotgun, defeat or make your way through waves of enemies and collect power-ups as you battle your way through each of the game's bosses. But there's a catch (there's always a catch): you've been cursed with an incredibly short attention span. Combat waves and upgrade cycles only last 10 seconds a piece, so you'd better act fast! But wait, there's more (information)! Fishy Features: - 10 second bursts of shoot â€˜em up action! - 6 different bosses! - 5 different, upgradeable weapons to choose from! - Over 30 upgrades to collect! Combine upgrades with different weapons for interesting combinations! - Hats! Over 30 of them! Some hats unlock hidden \"Hattributes\" which modify gameplay even further! - Local co-op! Work together or screw each other over when competing for the top score - There's also a remarkable number of cats!",
