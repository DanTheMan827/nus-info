	"description": "From the amazing diversity of galaxies and a new array of special suits for Mario to the incredible control scheme offered through the Wii Remote, Super Mario Galaxy is the ultimate Mario experience. Whether you’re a Mario master or playing one of his adventures for the first time, you’ll actively jump from planet to planet with the motion-sensing and pointing capabilities of the controller. Mario’s newest move – the spin move – is performed by giving the Wii Remote a quick shake. It’s the most versatile move in the game and can aide Mario in his many discoveries. Additionally, the Wii Remote’s pointer is used to collect Star Bits, which can be thrown at enemies to stun them. Another innovation involving the pointer is the new Co-Star Mode. In Co-Star Mode, a second player can manipulate the environment, helping the player who is controlling Mario by holding enemies in place and shooting Star Bits. The Co-Star can also help Mario perform special high jumps in coordination with the playing partner. ",
