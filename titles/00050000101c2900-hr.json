As always, this beat 'em up series truly shines with multiplayer and it is recommended to embark through this perilous journey with another friend! The NES™ version of Double Dragon III is different from the arcade version and introduces an innovative feature: the player can recruit two Bosses as allies and switch between characters at any time. This is the US version of the game.",
