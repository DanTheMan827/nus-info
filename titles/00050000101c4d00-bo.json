	"description": "Earth has fallen. Yet mankind endures, taking to the stars and crash-landing on an alien world in a desperate attempt to escape. Defend the survivors using high-tech weaponry on a mission to rebuild humanity. Suit up in heavily armed mechs to tame the wilds of planet Mira and beat back the hostile forces threatening to obliterate the human race. All of civilization faces annihilation from an intergalactic war between two alien races. Battle powerful creatures using a real-time combat system that is filled with tactical options. Tailor your character and mech to showcase your individuality and strength. Then equip them with customized weapons to dominate real-time battles. Conquer a huge world, and forge new friendships with alien beings. Stand together or fall. Humanity’s fate rests, like a sword, in your hand. The Xenoblade Chronicles X game can only be purchased as a digital download in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Availability of the game in packaged form varies by country. DLC is only usable when added to the full version of the game.",
