	"description": "What do you do when your first party is a raging success? You throw another one, of course! Mario and all of his famous friends have long since RSVP'd for Mario Party 2, so you'd be a fool to miss this fiesta. Like the original Mario Party, this star-studded sequel allows up to four players to compete in exciting interactive board games packed with surprises. Mario Party 2 features six all-new multiplayer Adventure Boards, and a special Quest Mode for players who prefer to party alone. There are 64 action-packed mini-games in Mario Party 2. Most of these games present brand new challenges, and some are updated versions of the best mini-games from the first Mario Party. Mario Party 2 expands on the great visual style that was established in the original game. Each Adventure Board features a unique theme, and the characters dress differently depending on where they are playing. Nothing delivers more replay value than great multiplayer gaming, and Mario Party 2 has been developed specifically for that purpose. The first Mario Party Pak was a hoot, and Mario Party 2 has enough atmosphere and new surprises to keep your shindig raging all night long. If you own this title on your Wii™, perform a system transfer from your Wii to your Wii U™ to receive a special upgrade price. This is the US version of the game.",
