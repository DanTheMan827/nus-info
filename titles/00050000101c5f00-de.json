	"description": "Sanatory Hallways is a two player game, where one player takes the role over Charla, a young student girl who commonly has nightmares and wants to break free. The other player is Mr. Spook, a ghastly appearance who loves to frighten Charla by using one of his many Spook Powers. In order for Charla to break free, she needs to find the blue key and escape from her dream via the exit, a simple blue door. Mr. Spook can prevent her from escaping by scaring her enough until her sanity drops to zero. This is done either via direct approach or the usage of one of his many tricks, like creating traps, slowing down doors, draining electricity from rooms and more. Charla can defend herself with her flashlight, as Mr. Spook is allergic to illumination. This game also contains Bonus levels for singleplayer usage, where Charla slowly finds out the reason why she keeps having those nightmares. More levels for both VS Mode and Singleplayer are planned to be released for free in the near future.",
