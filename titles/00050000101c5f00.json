		"description": "Sanatory Hallways is a two player game, where one player takes the role over Charla, a young student girl who commonly has nightmares and wants to break free. The other player is Mr. Spook, a ghastly appearance who loves to frighten Charla by using one of his many Spook Powers. In order for Charla to break free, she needs to find the blue key and escape from her dream via the exit, a simple blue door. Mr. Spook can prevent her from escaping by scaring her enough until her sanity drops to zero. This is done either via direct approach or the usage of one of his many tricks, like creating traps, slowing down doors, draining electricity from rooms and more. Charla can defend herself with her flashlight, as Mr. Spook is allergic to illumination. This game also contains Bonus levels for singleplayer usage, where Charla slowly finds out the reason why she keeps having those nightmares. More levels for both VS Mode and Singleplayer are planned to be released for free in the near future.",

		"description": "Sanatory Hallways est un jeu pouvant se jouer seul ou à deux. En mode Versus, un des joueurs incarne le rôle de Charla, une jeune étudiante essayant d'échapper au monde mystérieux qui hante ses cauchemars. L'autre joueur prend le rôle de Mr. Spook, un être fantômatique s'amusant à effrayer Charla en utilisant un de ses nombreux pouvoirs surnaturels. Ces derniers sont appelés Power Epouvanter. Pour s'enfuir de ce monde cauchemardesque, Charla devra mettre la main sur une clé bleue ayant le pouvoir d'ouvrir la porte du Monde des Rêves, bleue elle-aussi. De son côté Mr. Spook peut se mettre en travers du chemin de Charla, et l'effrayer afin de faire tomber sa santé mentale à zéro, et ainsi la garder prisonnière de ses cauchemars. Il peut lui faire peur en se manifestant directement sous différentes formes, ou en utilisant un de ses nombreux tours ; en créant des pièges, en ralentissant l'ouverture de portes ou encore en coupant le courant dans une des pièces. Le seul moyen de défense pour Charla est d'éclairer Mr.Spook avec sa lampe de poche. En effet celui-ci n'aime pas être exposé à une lumière vive. Ce jeu peut aussi être joué en solo grâce aux Niveaux Bonus, au cours desquels Charla découvre progressivement la raison de ses nombreux cauchemars.",

		"description": "Sanatory Hallways est un jeu pouvant se jouer seul ou à deux. En mode Versus, un des joueurs incarne le rôle de Charla, une jeune étudiante essayant d'échapper au monde mystérieux qui hante ses cauchemars. L'autre joueur prend le rôle de Mr. Spook, un être fantômatique s'amusant à effrayer Charla en utilisant un de ses nombreux pouvoirs surnaturels. Ces derniers sont appelés Power Epouvanter. Pour s'enfuir de ce monde cauchemardesque, Charla devra mettre la main sur une clé bleue ayant le pouvoir d'ouvrir la porte du Monde des Rêves, bleue elle-aussi. De son côté Mr. Spook peut se mettre en travers du chemin de Charla, et l'effrayer afin de faire tomber sa santé mentale à zéro, et ainsi la garder prisonnière de ses cauchemars. Il peut lui faire peur en se manifestant directement sous différentes formes, ou en utilisant un de ses nombreux tours ; en créant des pièges, en ralentissant l'ouverture de portes ou encore en coupant le courant dans une des pièces. Le seul moyen de défense pour Charla est d'éclairer Mr.Spook avec sa lampe de poche. En effet celui-ci n'aime pas être exposé à une lumière vive. Ce jeu peut aussi être joué en solo grâce aux Niveaux Bonus, au cours desquels Charla découvre progressivement la raison de ses nombreux cauchemars.",

		"description": "Sanatory Hallways est un jeu pouvant se jouer seul ou à deux. En mode Versus, un des joueurs incarne le rôle de Charla, une jeune étudiante essayant d'échapper au monde mystérieux qui hante ses cauchemars. L'autre joueur prend le rôle de Mr. Spook, un être fantômatique s'amusant à effrayer Charla en utilisant un de ses nombreux pouvoirs surnaturels. Ces derniers sont appelés Power Epouvanter. Pour s'enfuir de ce monde cauchemardesque, Charla devra mettre la main sur une clé bleue ayant le pouvoir d'ouvrir la porte du Monde des Rêves, bleue elle-aussi. De son côté Mr. Spook peut se mettre en travers du chemin de Charla, et l'effrayer afin de faire tomber sa santé mentale à zéro, et ainsi la garder prisonnière de ses cauchemars. Il peut lui faire peur en se manifestant directement sous différentes formes, ou en utilisant un de ses nombreux tours ; en créant des pièges, en ralentissant l'ouverture de portes ou encore en coupant le courant dans une des pièces. Le seul moyen de défense pour Charla est d'éclairer Mr.Spook avec sa lampe de poche. En effet celui-ci n'aime pas être exposé à une lumière vive. Ce jeu peut aussi être joué en solo grâce aux Niveaux Bonus, au cours desquels Charla découvre progressivement la raison de ses nombreux cauchemars.",

The other player is Mr. Spook, a ghastly appearance who loves to frighten Charla by using one of his many Spook Powers. In order for Charla to break free, she needs to find the blue key and escape from her dream via the exit, a simple blue door. Mr. Spook can prevent her from escaping by scaring her enough until her sanity drops to zero. This is done either via direct approach or the usage of one of his many tricks, like creating traps, slowing down doors, draining electricity from rooms and more. Charla can defend herself with her flashlight, as Mr. Spook is allergic to illumination. This game also contains Bonus levels for singleplayer usage, where Charla slowly finds out the reason why she keeps having those nightmares. More levels for both VS Mode and Singleplayer are planned to be released for free in the near future.",

		"description": "Sanatory Hallways is a two player game, where one player takes the role over Charla, a young student girl who commonly has nightmares and wants to break free. The other player is Mr. Spook, a ghastly appearance who loves to frighten Charla by using one of his many Spook Powers. In order for Charla to break free, she needs to find the blue key and escape from her dream via the exit, a simple blue door. Mr. Spook can prevent her from escaping by scaring her enough until her sanity drops to zero. This is done either via direct approach or the usage of one of his many tricks, like creating traps, slowing down doors, draining electricity from rooms and more. Charla can defend herself with her flashlight, as Mr. Spook is allergic to illumination. This game also contains Bonus levels for singleplayer usage, where Charla slowly finds out the reason why she keeps having those nightmares. More levels for both VS Mode and Singleplayer are planned to be released for free in the near future.",
