	"description": "Upon exploring a mysterious island, Kirby gets divided into 10 copies of himself by the evil leader of the Skull Gang. Kirby must gather all of his clones and defeat the gang to reverse the curse. Kirby™ Mass Attack is played with the stylus and touch screen of your Wii U™ GamePad. Find the copies of Kirby and guide up to 10 of them at the same time by tapping on the screen. The more clones of Kirby you control, the stronger you are; some obstacles can only be passed by having the right amount!",
