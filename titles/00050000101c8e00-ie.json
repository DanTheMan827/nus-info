	"description": "Get ready for Drop It: Block Paradise, a physics-puzzle game where your goal is to guide stars from their lofty heights to safe ground by touching the colorful blocks they stand on. You won’t have to go it alone - helpful siblings Tip and Tap are always on hand to give you some tutorial tips on where to tap. The better your results on each stage, the more stars you can earn to unlock concept art, stamps, and funky beats to jam out to! 150 levels in all await you, but that’s just the beginning. Edit Mode gives you access to all the tools used in the main game, with tons of customization so you can create the perfect level. But what good is a level if there’s no one to share it with? Luckily, you can upload your magnum opus to the Block Database for all to play, as well as enjoy the myriad of crazy creations other players have come up with!",
