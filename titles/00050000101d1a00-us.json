	"description": "Looking for a puzzle game all about skill, rather than luck? Aenigma Os may look familiar, but plays like nothing else you’ve seen before. Innovative gap-based matching, and refills controlled by you, the player, add layers of depth beyond anything else out there. Plan ahead, move key pieces to where you need them, and go up against hundreds of levels, puzzles and varied modes. Oh and MULTIPLAYER to boot! With great gameplay and scores of hours of content, not to mention banging tunes and beautiful, animated backgrounds, what’s not to like?",
