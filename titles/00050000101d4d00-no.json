	"description": "Somewhere along the venerable Route 7, in the middle of nowhere, you will find Joe’s Diner. As an employee working the graveyard shift for the next month, your primary task is to keep the tables clean – no tough challenge at all. Unfortunately, there is a rub to it. The old Diner was built on the site of a former Indian cemetery. Amongst the buried, two rival chieftains lay to rest; while alive, each could not stand the other. One chieftain endeavors only to rest in peace. The other, a prankster both in life and the afterlife, is prone to ruffle the feathers of his fellow chief. Besides your tasks as a waiter, it is up to you to keep things calm and not incur the angry chieftains’ wrath. To lay them both to everlasting rest just do your duty. Sounds easy but it is not – promised. - Work over 30 night shifts as a holiday replacement - Keep things calm to not incur the angry chieftains’ wrath - Atmospheric graphics - Premium sound scenery and effects",
