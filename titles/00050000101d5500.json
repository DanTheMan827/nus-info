As an employee working the graveyard shift for the next month, your primary task is to keep the tables clean – no tough challenge at all. Unfortunately, there is a rub to it. The old Diner was built on the site of a former Indian cemetery. Amongst the buried, two rival chieftains lay to rest; while alive, each could not stand the other. One chieftain endeavors only to rest in peace. The other, a prankster both in life and the afterlife, is prone to ruffle the feathers of his fellow chief. Besides your tasks as a waiter, it is up to you to keep things calm and not incur the angry chieftains’ wrath. To lay them both to everlasting rest just do your duty. Sounds easy but it is not – promised. Work over 30 night shifts as a holiday replacement Keep things calm to not incur the angry chieftains’ wrath Atmospheric graphics Premium sound scenery and effects",
