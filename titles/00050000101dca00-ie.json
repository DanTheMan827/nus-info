	"description": "Create 3D models of your own design and render them with realistic lighting and shadows. Voxel models are made from 3D cubes and create a stylised \"blocky\" look – like 3D pixel art. VoxelMaker’s fully-featured model editor makes use of both buttons and touch controls, allowing you to cut, copy and paste part of your model to move, rotate or duplicate sections with ease. You can also insert text, paint colours onto your model, and control light direction and intensity in your scene. Then, use the built-in ray tracer to render high quality images of your scenes and save them to your Screenshot Album, or share them on Miiverse. With VoxelMaker, you have both a 3D canvas and camera in your hands: be inspired and create! - Create 3D models using a full-featured model editor - Use buttons and the touch screen to edit your model and set up your scene - Make parts of your model glow, or be transparent like glass - Render views of your scene with configurable shadow softness, ambient light, and depth of field - Save rendered scenes to your Screenshot Album, or share them on Miiverse",
