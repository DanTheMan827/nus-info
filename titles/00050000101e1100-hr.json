	"description": "Become a Top Ranger and protect hundreds of different types of Pokémon from an evil corporation in Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia. The second title in the Pokémon Ranger series once again calls on you to capture Pokémon and then use their abilities to save the day. This time around, however, you’ll encounter 50 additional Pokémon that weren’t in the original game, including many from Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl. Starting out in Ranger School as a Student Ranger, you’re bursting with enthusiasm at the prospect of one day becoming a Top Ranger and using your knowledge for the good of Almia and its many Pokémon. Little did you know, after graduation you would soon be putting your new skills to work in a quest that would determine the very future of the region.",
