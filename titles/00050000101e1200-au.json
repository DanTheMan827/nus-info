	"description": "PixelJunk Monsters™ is a tower defence game where you play as Tikiman, the Forest Defender. He’s in trouble, with hordes of monsters sweeping through his realm, hoping to chow down on his offspring – and it’s up to you to defend them! By placing weapon towers at strategic points around the landscape, you can destroy the invaders and save the little ones. Choose from a whole host of towers: Arrow Towers, Cannon Towers, Anti-Air Towers, Ice Towers, Fire Towers, Laser Towers, Tesla Towers, Mortar Towers, special power ups and more! Collect treasure along the way to build up your arsenal and pay for new towers – countless waves of monsters are out to get the babies, so you need to be prepared to battle! Travel across 3 distinct islands, spanning 47 unique environments to protect Tikiman’s offspring from clever monsters that attack by land and air. Play together with a friend with local co-op for a memorable shared experience. There is also the mysterious Tum-Tum Island that randomly generates levels for near infinite replayability! ",
