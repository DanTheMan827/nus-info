	"description": "Dragon Skills features classic arcade gameplay inspired by well-known classic games from the 1970s. You have to destroy all stones in a level like in a classic brick breaker game. In Dragon Skills, though, the ball has a tail which gets longer and longer. And crossing the tail with the ball will trigger rewards for the player. In each level, the player aims for the ultimate high score. To achieve the highest score, the use of dragon skills will be necessary. There are two different types of skills: 1. Skills that have positive or negative influence on the player and are activated instantly after collecting. 2. Skills that can be stored in a bag and may be activated anytime. Furthermore Dragon skills can be upgraded by collecting emeralds to make them more powerful. The game also rewards skilled players with 5 speed levels, the ball will get faster and each single stone will score more points. Dragon Skills is a typical arcade game which is easy to play but hard to master.",
