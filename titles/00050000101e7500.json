Dans chaque niveau le joueur pourra tenter dâ€™atteindre le score maximal. Pour atteindre ce score, il faut utiliser les Â« dragon skills Â» Ã  bon escient. Il y a deux types de pouvoirs : 1. Les pouvoirs qui peuvent avoir un effet positif ou negatif sur le joueur, et qui sâ€™activent automatiquement lorsquâ€™ils sont ramassÃ©s. 2. Les pouvoirs qui peuvent mis en rÃ©serve et activÃ©s Ã  volontÃ©. De plus, les Â« dragon skills Â» peuvent Ãªtre amÃ©liorÃ©s en ramassant des Ã©meraudes pour les rendre plus puissants. Le jeu rÃ©compense aussi les joueurs les plus habiles avec diffÃ©rent niveaux de vitesse, rendant la balle plus rapide et ajoutant un bonus aux points de chaque brique dÃ©truite.

Cependant, dans Dragon Skills la balle comporte une queue qui se rallonge au fur et Ã  mesure, et en laissant la balle croiser la queue, le joueur peut recevoir des rÃ©compenses. Dans chaque niveau le joueur pourra tenter dâ€™atteindre le score maximal. Pour atteindre ce score, il faut utiliser les Â« dragon skills Â» Ã  bon escient. Il y a deux types de pouvoirs : 1. Les pouvoirs qui peuvent avoir un effet positif ou negatif sur le joueur, et qui sâ€™activent automatiquement lorsquâ€™ils sont ramassÃ©s. 2. Les pouvoirs qui peuvent mis en rÃ©serve et activÃ©s Ã  volontÃ©. De plus, les Â« dragon skills Â» peuvent Ãªtre amÃ©liorÃ©s en ramassant des Ã©meraudes pour les rendre plus puissants. Le jeu rÃ©compense aussi les joueurs les plus habiles avec diffÃ©rent niveaux de vitesse, rendant la balle plus rapide et ajoutant un bonus aux points de chaque brique dÃ©truite. Dragons Skills est un jeu dâ€™arcade typique, avec une prise en main facile, mais difficile Ã  maÃ®triser.",

Il faut dÃ©truire toutes les briques dans chaque niveau comme dans un jeu de casse-brique classique. Cependant, dans Dragon Skills la balle comporte une queue qui se rallonge au fur et Ã  mesure, et en laissant la balle croiser la queue, le joueur peut recevoir des rÃ©compenses. Dans chaque niveau le joueur pourra tenter dâ€™atteindre le score maximal. Pour atteindre ce score, il faut utiliser les Â« dragon skills Â» Ã  bon escient. Il y a deux types de pouvoirs : 1. Les pouvoirs qui peuvent avoir un effet positif ou negatif sur le joueur, et qui sâ€™activent automatiquement lorsquâ€™ils sont ramassÃ©s. 2. Les pouvoirs qui peuvent mis en rÃ©serve et activÃ©s Ã  volontÃ©. De plus, les Â« dragon skills Â» peuvent Ãªtre amÃ©liorÃ©s en ramassant des Ã©meraudes pour les rendre plus puissants. Le jeu rÃ©compense aussi les joueurs les plus habiles avec diffÃ©rent niveaux de vitesse, rendant la balle plus rapide et ajoutant un bonus aux points de chaque brique dÃ©truite. Dragons Skills est un jeu dâ€™arcade typique, avec une prise en main facile, mais difficile Ã  maÃ®triser.",

In each level, the player aims for the ultimate high score. To achieve the highest score, the use of dragon skills will be necessary. There are two different types of skills: 1. Skills that have positive or negative influence on the player and are activated instantly after collecting. 2. Skills that can be stored in a bag and may be activated anytime. Furthermore Dragon skills can be upgraded by collecting emeralds to make them more powerful. The game also rewards skilled players with 5 speed levels, the ball will get faster and each single stone will score more points. Dragon Skills is a typical arcade game which is easy to play but hard to master.",
