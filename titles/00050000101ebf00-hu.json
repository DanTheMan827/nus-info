	"description": "Captain Olimar has just returned home, and is pleased to be in one piece. After crash-landing on an alien planet, he quickly learned that the only way to escape was to utilise the talents of the Pikmin: the cutest little creatures that under his command sought out the scattered components of his beloved spacecraft. With only 30 days to complete the mission before his emergency oxygen supplies ran out, Olimar will never forget the Pikmin who aided him in his hour of need. The NEW PLAY CONTROL! series from Nintendo features Nintendo GameCube classics updated for Wii! New features, new experiences and, most importantly, new ways to control the games are waiting for you, whether you’re new to the titles or have played the originals on GameCube.",
