	"description": "WarioWare is back with a whole new set of moves! When Wario stumbles upon a strange device called a Form Baton, he and his friends use it to learn new moves that are as fun as they are wacky. With hundreds of microgames, this game is just as wild as you’d expect from the name WarioWare, but the gameplay has been revolutionised. Under Wario’s tutelage, and with the help of the Wii Remote, players will swing, spin and squat their way to victory. With about 200 lightning-quick microgames and controls that range from scribbling to flailing, WarioWare: Smooth Moves takes interactive gaming to a whole new level! All players need is a Wii Remote and their best moves to be the champ. With games that are as much fun to play as they are to WATCH people play, WarioWare: Smooth Moves brings the party to its feet. It’s hilarious for players and audiences alike.",
