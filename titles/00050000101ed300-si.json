	"description": "When an army of invaders infiltrate Donkey Kong’s jungle home and help themselves to every banana they can get their hands on, you know there’s going to be trouble. With a rumbling stomach and the support of some fellow banana-starved buddies, the agitated ape sets out to reclaim what’s rightfully his and liberate the kingdoms he passes through in the process. As you advance through a world rich in adventure, you’ll gradually find the perfect rhythm with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk - stringing together DK’s many moves by making intuitive movements of your own. Once you’ve got a firm grasp of the rhythms of the jungle, you can expect to enjoy a unique sense of satisfaction as the subtleties of your combined gestures translate into inch-perfect platforming exploits from the monkey on your telly. The NEW PLAY CONTROL! series from Nintendo features Nintendo GameCube classics updated for Wii! New features, new experiences and, most importantly, new ways to control the games await, whether you’re new to the titles or have played the originals on GameCube.",
