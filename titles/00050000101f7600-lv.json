	"description": "Pew! Pew! Pew! Dual Core is a vibrant, futuristic, \"twin-stick\" style, shooter, with a strong focus on local co-op multiplayer. It's 2147 and the human colony on Europa has suffered a terrible fate. Rebooting after hibernation, two super-intelligent AI cores awake to find themselves installed within a couple of old security drones. Their attempts to uncover what occurred may end up becoming a lower priority than merely surviving... Lots of robots, lots of lasers, lots of aliens, lots of explosions! The numerous retro arcade influences are front and center, but spiced up with a colorful modern style, a generous helping of sci-fi intrigue, and a dash of RPG ELEMENTS! - Don't fight alone! Up to 4 players can battle together in local co-op, but you'll always have your trusty (AI-controlled) robo-buddies by your side. - Story mode sees you battle through a ton of handcrafted levels as you attempt to shed light on the calamity that befell the colony. - Arcade mode is a straight up arena-shooter, where you battle wave after endless wave of the alien horde. - Versus mode pits you against up to 3 friends (or AI controlled bots - If your friends are wasting their time doing something other than playing Dual Core).",
