	"description": "Hurry up, time flies!!! Hunt as many birds as possible before the time runs out. With several different types of objectives, you are given a unique and challenging variety from start to finish. Look, aim and fire! Feel like a real hunter thanks to the precision of the Wii Remote™ and Wii Zapper™. It is also compatible with Wii U™ GamePad that supports Off-TV mode. Be the best hunter and compete face to face with friends and family in the two multiplayer modes for up to 4 players. 1- 'VS' Mode includes 2 types of games: 'Time Trial' and 'Hot Balloon'. Where you compete against everyone with a leaderboard to see who's the best. 2- 'COOP' Mode includes 2 types of games: 'Tornado' and 'Abduction.' Where everyone plays together to survive as long they can and to beat new records. Each scene is distinct and is procedurally generated providing a unique experience. The weather is very important in the game and it won't be on your side: rain, fog, back-lighting and even tornadoes won't make it easy. Apart from the multiplayer mode, the game includes several mini-games that will test your skills, reflexes and memory. And if you're skilled you earn coins and redeem them for weapon upgrades to break new records on that level. Hurry Up! Bird Hunter is a simple but complete game where you will spend a long time alone or with your friends and family.",
