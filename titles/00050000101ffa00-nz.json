Solve hundreds of pencil-and-paper style puzzles using the stylus and a choice of intuitive touch-screen controls or handwriting recognition.

Ladders Make new words by changing one letter at a time. Can you turn one word into another in a limited number of steps? Crypto A cipher puzzle (also known as a cryptogram) which reveals a quote when you crack the code! Word Sudoku It's sudoku with words! Place nine letters according to usual sudoku rules.
