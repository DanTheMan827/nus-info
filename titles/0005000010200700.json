Entourés de créatures étranges et de la population locale qui l’est encore plus, Cora et ses amis ne peuvent compter que sur leur courage et une poignée de pistolets à eau ! Mais heureusement pour notre trio de courageux étrangers, l’eau de cette étrange nouvelle contrée est dotée de mystérieuses propriétés ; elle transforme leurs pistolets à eau ordinaires en de puissantes armes. Lancez-vous dans une aventure épique que vous pourrez partager à cinq joueurs. Explorez les îles célestes à couper le souffle d’Evan, et aidez leurs habitants en complétant des quêtes difficiles et en venant à bout des hordes de monstres qui infestent les lieux. Twisted Fusion vous fera vivre une expérience en « open world », permettant aux joueurs de choisir leur propre voie pour trouver le chemin du retour à la maison. Utilisez le Wii U™ GamePad pour accéder à une multitude d’applications sur le smartphone de Cora. Suivez l’heure et la météo, vérifiez la progression de votre quête, utilisez les déplacements rapides et débloquez de nouveaux personnages, costumes, capacités et gadgets. Vous pourrez même recueillir et entraîner votre propre équipe de monstres. Bloqués dans un monde étrange, nos héros veulent seulement rentrer à la maison. Pourront-ils surmonter les forces obscures qui cherchent à entraver leur mission?",

Entourés de créatures étranges et de la population locale qui l’est encore plus, Cora et ses amis ne peuvent compter que sur leur courage et une poignée de pistolets à eau ! Mais heureusement pour notre trio de courageux étrangers, l’eau de cette étrange nouvelle contrée est dotée de mystérieuses propriétés ; elle transforme leurs pistolets à eau ordinaires en de puissantes armes. Lancez-vous dans une aventure épique que vous pourrez partager à cinq joueurs. Explorez les îles célestes à couper le souffle d’Evan, et aidez leurs habitants en complétant des quêtes difficiles et en venant à bout des hordes de monstres qui infestent les lieux. Twisted Fusion vous fera vivre une expérience en « open world », permettant aux joueurs de choisir leur propre voie pour trouver le chemin du retour à la maison. Utilisez le Wii U™ GamePad pour accéder à une multitude d’applications sur le smartphone de Cora. Suivez l’heure et la météo, vérifiez la progression de votre quête, utilisez les déplacements rapides et débloquez de nouveaux personnages, costumes, capacités et gadgets. Vous pourrez même recueillir et entraîner votre propre équipe de monstres. Bloqués dans un monde étrange, nos héros veulent seulement rentrer à la maison. Pourront-ils surmonter les forces obscures qui cherchent à entraver leur mission?",

Entourés de créatures étranges et de la population locale qui l’est encore plus, Cora et ses amis ne peuvent compter que sur leur courage et une poignée de pistolets à eau ! Mais heureusement pour notre trio de courageux étrangers, l’eau de cette étrange nouvelle contrée est dotée de mystérieuses propriétés ; elle transforme leurs pistolets à eau ordinaires en de puissantes armes. Lancez-vous dans une aventure épique que vous pourrez partager à cinq joueurs. Explorez les îles célestes à couper le souffle d’Evan, et aidez leurs habitants en complétant des quêtes difficiles et en venant à bout des hordes de monstres qui infestent les lieux. Twisted Fusion vous fera vivre une expérience en « open world », permettant aux joueurs de choisir leur propre voie pour trouver le chemin du retour à la maison. Utilisez le Wii U™ GamePad pour accéder à une multitude d’applications sur le smartphone de Cora. Suivez l’heure et la météo, vérifiez la progression de votre quête, utilisez les déplacements rapides et débloquez de nouveaux personnages, costumes, capacités et gadgets. Vous pourrez même recueillir et entraîner votre propre équipe de monstres. Bloqués dans un monde étrange, nos héros veulent seulement rentrer à la maison. Pourront-ils surmonter les forces obscures qui cherchent à entraver leur mission?",
