	"description": "Ghost Blade HD is an intense bullet-hell shoot 'em up game, with satisfying and addictive score-based gameplay, with its tradition going back to the shooting games of the 1990s era. Designed with a modern graphic style and special effects, Ghost Blade also features an awesome 2-player mode! Ghost Blade HD Is easy to learn, yet hard to master. The Soundtrack based on the heydays of Japanese shmups and arcade sounds: Composer Rafael Dyll has already scored several console games (Söldner X-2. Rainbow Moon) and returns to his signature sound with the music featured in The Ghost Blade. Fusing J-Pop influences and typical 90s synths and with modern production values, Rafael provides an action-packed soundtrack with catchy leads and electronic beats. Story: 10,000 years ago an Artificial Intelligence known as Shira was built to protect the residents of Mars. As time passed the AI became corrupted and Shira started to attack the Mars colonies.

However, ‘Evil Shira’ secretly had a backup that flees into space and takes over an abandoned space station at the outskirts of the solar system.
