		"description": "SIX SIDES OF THE WORLD – LARGA VIDA AL DIOS DE LOS PUZLES “Six Sides of the World” es un videojuego de puzles que te sumerge en una aventura intergaláctica a través de diferentes sistemas espaciales plagados de desafíos que atentarán contra tu cerebro. EL ENFRENTAMIENTO DEFINITIVO: TU MENTE vs PELIGROS DE CIENCIA FICCIÓN La orientación espacial, la lógica y el puro ingenio serán tus mejores armas para superar los diferentes planetas cúbicos repletos de puzles. Cada nivel presentará desafíos cada vez más peligrosos, añadiendo todo tipo de amenazas propias de la ciencia ficción: desde portales hasta rayos láser. Tendrás que analizar cuidadosamente cada planeta, así como cada una de sus caras para entender sus peligros y sus soluciones potenciales. Apresurarte puede llevarte a la muerte: conocer el ritmo de cada puzle será clave para solucionarlo. EXPLORA UN VASTO SISTEMA GALÁCTICO Six Sides of the World presenta una serie de sistemas estelares que explorar. Cada uno está compuesto por diferentes puzles que van introduciendo nuevas y desafiantes mecánicas. Pero la característica más interesante de todo esto es que los sistemas estelares pueden ser navegados de manera lineal, siguiendo el camino predeterminado y más sencillo; o bien puedes tomar desvíos si eres lo suficientemente valiente. Algunos puzles tienen más de una solución posible, permitiendo al jugador llevar su capacidad al límite para desbloquear puzles secretos. ¡DE PASATIEMPO A DOLOR DE CABEZA! La libertad de exploración en Six Sides of the World te permite elegir la dificultad: el camino lineal requiere una mente resolutiva e inteligente; pero las soluciones extra de algunos puzles requieren una verdadera capacidad de entender sus mecánicas ¡Y eso no es todo! Estas soluciones te llevarán hacia niveles secretos que serán capaces de volverte loco. Es una manera ingeniosa de permitir al jugador escoger la dificultad del reto: ir a por la solución adicional es una manera de enfrentarse a desafíos de mayor calibre. ¡Y los niveles extra son los desafíos más exigentes! Hay una diferencia entre entender cómo funciona una mecánica y llevar dicha mecánica hasta sus últimas e intrincadas consecuencias. ¿Estás preparado? ¡LARGA VIDA AL DIOS DE LOS PUZLES! Maigo es un explorador que está a punto de descubrir algo mucho más grande de lo que espera. Mientras navega a través del espacio, haciendo frente a difíciles puzles, empezará a entender que está acercándose a un secreto trascendental. Las preguntas resonarán en su mente: ¿Quién ha creado estos misteriosos planetas? ¿Qué motiva a este arquitecto intergaláctico? ¿Hay un plan tras todo esto? ¿Es un test? ¿Es un método para proteger algo? Buscando la verdad, Maigo tendrá que superar todos los desafíos para dar con esta especie de… DIOS DE LOS PUZLES. Características -Una galaxia de puzles: Docenas de puzles a cual más creativo y desafiante creados sobre planetas cúbicos. -Escoge tu propia manera de ganar: Progresión no lineal con distintos niveles de dificultad. Sigue los niveles menos complicados para acabar el juego; pero explora los niveles secretos para hacer frente al verdadero desafío. -Controles sencillos e intuitivos. -Música de otro mundo: Banda sonora compuesta por Carlos Viola.",

THE ULTIMATE MATCH: YOUR BRAINS vs SCI-FI HAZARDS Spatial orientation, logic and pure wit will be your weapons to go through the different cube shaped planetary systems. Each level will bring the threats to a whole new level, adding all kinds of sci-fi hazards: from portals to laser beams.You will need to carefully analyze each cubic planet to understand its dangers and potential solutions. Rushing might lead you to death: it’s all about breaking down each puzzle and finding the right pace. EXPLORE A VAST GALAXY SYSTEM Six Sides of the World presents you a series of star systems to be explored. Each one is comprised by different puzzles that introduce new and more challenging mechanics. But most interesting feature of this is that these star systems can be navigated linearly, following a easier predetermined path; or you can make a detour if you are brave enough. Some of the puzzles will present more than one possible solution, enabling the player to achieve a more difficult victory, that will unlock new extra puzzles. FROM TEST OF WIT TO ULTIMATE HEADACHE! The freedom of exploration in Six Sides of the World let you set the difficulty: the linear path takes an intelligent and resolutive mind; but the additional solutions to some of the puzzles require a true sense of understanding of each puzzle. And that’s not all! These solutions will lead you to extra puzzles that are capable of driving you insane. It is a smart way of letting the player to set the difficulty by him/herself: going for the extra solution is a way of asking for bigger challenges. And the extra levels are the biggest challenges you can face! There is a difference between understanding new mechanics and getting to their true core. Are you ready? ALL HAIL THE PUZZLE LORD! Maigo is an explorer who’s about to discover something far bigger than he expects. As he navigates through space, facing increasingly difficult puzzles, he starts to understand he’s tapping over something transcendent. Some questions arise: who has created all these worlds? What motivates this intergalactic architect? There’s an utter plan beyond all this? It is a test? A mean to protect something? In seek of the truth Maigo will have to overcome all the challenges to meet this kind of… PUZZLE GOD. FEATURES -A galaxy of puzzles: Dozens of creative, defying and engaging puzzles set in cubic planetary systems -Choose your way to victory: Non-linear progression with different difficulty levels. Follow the easy levels to end the game, explore the optional ones to face a real challenge. -Easy to control, hard to master:Easy and intuitive controls. -Otherworldly music: Soundtrack composed by Carlos Viola.",
