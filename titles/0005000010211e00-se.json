	"description": "Did you know that every drawing we make can come to life in the World of Drawings ? A resident of this world contacts you because he needs your help ! To convince you to help him, he offers to tell you his misadventures. With him you'll go from one sheet of paper to another, each with a hand-drawn background. Pencil, pastel, painting... Detailed or simplistic... Every place visited is unique ! Talk to other drawings, pick up and use objects to advance your journey. Some dangers may also prove useful : ink stain, torn sheet... Perform all actions with simple controls : just point elements on the screen with the Wiimote and press a single button to realize most interactions. So go on to A Drawing's Journey !",
